Trends in architecture of high performance computing systems necessitate analysis algorithms to make effective use of combinations of massively multicore and distributed systems. One of the principal analytic tools is the contour tree, which analyses relationships between contours to identify features of more than local importance. Unfortunately, the predominant algorithms for computing the contour tree are explicitly serial, and founded on serial metaphors, which has limited the scalability of this form of analysis. While there is some work on distributed contour tree computation, and separately on hybrid GPU-CPU computation, there is no efficient algorithm with strong formal guarantees on performance allied with fast practical performance. We report the first shared SMP algorithm for fully parallel contour tree computation, with formal guarantees of O(lgnlgt) parallel steps and O(nlgn) work, and implementations with more than 30* parallel speed up on both CPU using TBB and GPU using Thrust and up 70* speed up compared to the serial sweep and merge algorithm.", "cite": 1, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Drag and Track: A Direct Manipulation Interface for Contextualizing Data Instances within a Continuous Parameter Space", "author": ["Orban,Daniel", "Keefe,DanielF.", "Biswas,Ayan", "Ahrens,James", "Rogers,David"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865051", "keywords": "", "abstract": "We present a direct manipulation technique that allows material scientists to interactively highlight relevant parameterized simulation instances located in dimensionally reduced spaces, enabling a user-defined understanding of a continuous parameter space. Our goals are two-fold: first, to build a user-directed intuition of dimensionally reduced data. and second, to provide a mechanism for creatively exploring parameter relationships in parameterized simulation sets, called ensembles. We start by visualizing ensemble data instances in dimensionally reduced scatter plots. To understand these abstract views, we employ user-defined virtual data instances that, through direct manipulation, search an ensemble for similar instances. Users can create multiple of these direct manipulation queries to visually annotate the spaces with sets of highlighted ensemble data instances. User-defined goals are therefore translated into custom illustrations that are projected onto the dimensionally reduced spaces. Combined forward and inverse searches of the parameter space follow naturally allowing for continuous parameter space prediction and visual query comparison in the context of an ensemble. The potential for this visualization technique is confirmed via expert user feedback for a shock physics application and synthetic model analysis.", "cite": 5, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Ahrens,James", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "8"}, {"source": "6", "target": "9"}, {"source": "7", "target": "8"}, {"source": "7", "target": "9"}, {"source": "8", "target": "9"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Ahrens,James", "1": "Carr,Hamish", "2": "Weber,GuntherH", "3": "Sewell,Christopher", "4": "Rubel,Oliver", "5": "Fasel,Patricia", "6": "Orban,Daniel", "7": "Keefe,DanielF.", "8": "Biswas,Ayan", "9": "Rogers,David"}}
