We report the results of a study comparing the effectiveness of the two primary techniques for showing network data: node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices. Specifically, an evaluation with a large number of online participants revealed statistically significant differences between the two visualizations. Our work adds to existing research in several ways. First, we explore a broad spectrum of network tasks, many of which had not been previously evaluated. Second, our study uses two large datasets, typical of many real-life networks not explored by previous studies. Third, we leverage crowdsourcing to evaluate many tasks with many participants. This paper is an expanded journal version of a Graph Drawing (GD'17) conference paper. We evaluated a second dataset, added a qualitative feedback section, and expanded the procedure, results, discussion, and limitations sections.", "cite": 5, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Kobourov,Stephen", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Kobourov,Stephen", "1": "Okoe,Mershack", "2": "Jianu,Radu"}}
