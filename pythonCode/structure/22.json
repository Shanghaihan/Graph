Despite that the critiques of rainbow colormaps have been around and well-acknowledged for three decades, rainbow colormaps are still widely used today. One reason behind the resilience of rainbow colormaps is the lack of tools for users to create a continuous colormap that encodes semantics specific to the application concerned. In this paper, we present a web-based software system, CCC-Tool (short for Charting Continuous Colormaps) under the URL https://ccctool.com, for creating, editing, and analyzing such application-specific colormaps. We introduce the notion of \"colormap specification (CMS)\" that maintains the essential semantics required for defining a color mapping scheme. We provide users with a set of advanced utilities for constructing CMS's with various levels of complexity, examining their quality attributes using different plots, and exporting them to external application software. We present two case studies, demonstrating that the CCC-tool can help domain scientists as well as visualization experts in designing semantically-rich colormaps.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Measuring and Modeling the Feature Detection Threshold Functions of Colormaps", "author": ["Ware,Colin", "Turton,TereceL.", "Bujack,Roxana", "Samsel,Francesca", "Shrivastava,Piyush", "Rogers,DavidH."], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2855742", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Pseudocoloring is one of the most common techniques used in scientific visualization. To apply pseudocoloring to a scalar field, the field value at each point is represented using one of a sequence of colors (called a colormap). One of the principles applied in generating colormaps is uniformity and previously the main method for determining uniformity has been the application of uniform color spaces. In this paper we present a new method for evaluating the feature detection threshold function across a colormap. The method is used in crowdsourced studies for the direct evaluation of nine colormaps for three feature sizes. The results are used to test the hypothesis that a uniform color space (CIELAB) will accurately model colormapped feature detection thresholds compared to a model where the chromaticity components have reduced weights. The hypothesis that feature detection can be predicted solely on the basis of luminance is also tested. The results reject both hypotheses and we demonstrate how reduced weights on the green-red and blue-yellow terms of the CIELAB color space creates a more accurate model when the task is the detection of smaller features in colormapped data. Both the method itself and modified CIELAB can be used in colormap design and evaluation.", "cite": 9, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Bujack,Roxana", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}, {"id": "20"}, {"id": "21"}, {"id": "22"}, {"id": "23"}, {"id": "24"}, {"id": "25"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "10"}, {"source": "2", "target": "11"}, {"source": "2", "target": "12"}, {"source": "2", "target": "13"}, {"source": "2", "target": "14"}, {"source": "2", "target": "15"}, {"source": "2", "target": "16"}, {"source": "2", "target": "17"}, {"source": "2", "target": "18"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "8"}, {"source": "3", "target": "9"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "5", "target": "19"}, {"source": "5", "target": "20"}, {"source": "5", "target": "21"}, {"source": "5", "target": "22"}, {"source": "5", "target": "23"}, {"source": "5", "target": "24"}, {"source": "5", "target": "25"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "8"}, {"source": "6", "target": "9"}, {"source": "7", "target": "8"}, {"source": "7", "target": "9"}, {"source": "8", "target": "9"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Bujack,Roxana", "1": "Nardini,Pascal", "2": "Chen,Min", "3": "Samsel,Francesca", "4": "Bottinger,Michael", "5": "Scheuermann,Gerik", "6": "Ware,Colin", "7": "Turton,TereceL.", "8": "Shrivastava,Piyush", "9": "Rogers,DavidH.", "10": "Streeb,Dirk", "11": "El-Assady,Mennatallah", "12": "Keim,Daniel", "13": "Gaither,Kelly", "14": "John,NigelW.", "15": "McCann,Brian", "16": "Sacha,Dominik", "17": "Kraus,Matthias", "18": "Keim,DanielA.", "19": "Raith,Felix", "20": "Blecha,Christian", "21": "Nagel,Thomas", "22": "Parisio,Francesco", "23": "Kolditz,Olaf", "24": "Guenther,Fabian", "25": "Stommel,Markus"}}
