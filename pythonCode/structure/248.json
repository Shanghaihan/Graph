A PSLM is a programmable reflective device that can selectively retardate, or delay, the incoming light rays. As a result, a PSLM works as a computational dynamic lens device. We demonstrate our computational phase-modulated eyeglasses with either a single PSLM or dual PSLMs and show that the concept can realize various optical operations including focus correction, bi-focus, image shift, and field of view manipulation, namely optical zoom. Compared to other programmable optics, computational phase-modulated eyeglasses have the advantage in terms of its versatility. In addition, we also presents some prototypical focus-loop applications where the lens is dynamically optimized based on distances of objects observed by a scene camera.

Existing optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs) form virtual images in an additive manner-they optically combine the light from an embedded light source such as a microdisplay into the users' field of view (FoV). Instead, our light attenuation display filters the color of the real background light pixel-wise in the users' see-through view. resulting in an image as a spatial color filter. Our image formation is complementary to existing light-additive OST-HMDs. The core optical component in our system is a phase-only spatial light modulator (PSLM). a liquid crystal module that can control the phase of the light in each pixel. By combining PSLMs with polarization optics, our system realizes a spatially programmable color filter.
