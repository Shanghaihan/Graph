Limited research has been conducted regarding suitable navigation visualizations. In this work, three navigation concepts based on existing approaches were compared in a user study using a projective AR setup. Each concept was implemented with three different scales for accuracy-to-color mapping and two methods of navigation indicator scaling. Participants were asked to perform simulated needle insertion tasks with each of the resulting 18 prototypes. Insertion angle and insertion depth accuracies were measured and analyzed, as well as task completion time and participants' subjectively perceived task difficulty. Results show a clear ranking of visualization concepts across variables. Less consistent results were obtained for the color and indicator scaling factors. Results suggest that logarithmic indicator scaling achieved better accuracy, but participants perceived it to be more difficult than linear scaling. With specific results for angle and depth accuracy, our study contributes to the future composition of improved navigation support and systems for precise needle insertion or similar applications.", "cite": 4, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Joeres,Fabian", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "7"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "8"}, {"source": "2", "target": "9"}, {"source": "2", "target": "10"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Joeres,Fabian", "1": "Heinrich,Florian", "2": "Lawonn,Kai", "3": "Hansen,Christian", "4": "Meuschke,Monique", "5": "Oeltze-Jafra,Steffen", "6": "Beuing,Oliver", "7": "Preim,Bernhard", "8": "Gunther,Tobias", "9": "Berg,Philipp", "10": "Wickenhoefer,Ralph"}}
