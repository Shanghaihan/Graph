We focus on integer label data, whose efficient representation in memory, as well as fast random data access, pose an even greater challenge than the raw image data. Often, it is crucial to be able to rapidly identify which segments are located where, whether for empty space skipping for fast rendering, or for spatial proximity queries. We refer to this process as culling. In order to enable efficient culling of millions of labeled segments, we present a novel hybrid approach that combines deterministic and probabilistic representations of label data in a data-adaptive hierarchical data structure that we call the label list tree. In each node, we adaptively encode label data using either a probabilistic constant-time access representation for fast conservative culling, or a deterministic logarithmic-time access representation for exact queries. We choose the best data structures for representing the labels of each spatial region while building the label list tree. At run time, we further employ a novel query-adaptive culling strategy. While filtering a query down the tree, we prune it successively, and in each node adaptively select the representation that is best suited for evaluating the pruned query, depending on its size. We show an analysis of the efficiency of our approach with several large data sets from connectomics, including a brain scan with more than 13 million labeled segments, and compare our method to conventional culling approaches. Our approach achieves significant reductions in storage size as well as faster query times.", "cite": 2, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Time-Dependent Flow seen through Approximate Observer Killing Fields", "author": ["Hadwiger,Markus", "Mlejnek,Matej", "Theussl,Thomas", "Rautek,Peter"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864839", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Flow fields are usually visualized relative to a global observer, i.e., a single frame of reference. However, often no global frame can depict all flow features equally well. Likewise, objective criteria for detecting features such as vortices often use either a global reference frame, or compute a separate frame for each point in space and time. We propose the first general framework that enables choosing a smooth trade-off between these two extremes. Using global optimization to minimize specific differential geometric properties, we compute a time-dependent observer velocity field that describes the motion of a continuous field of observers adapted to the input flow. This requires developing the novel notion of an observed time derivative. While individual observers are restricted to rigid motions. overall we compute an approximate Killing field, corresponding to almost-rigid motion. This enables continuous transitions between different observers. Instead of focusing only on flow features, we furthermore develop a novel general notion of visualizing how all observers jointly perceive the input field. This in fact requires introducing the concept of an observation time, with respect to which a visualization is computed. We develop the corresponding notions of observed stream, path. streak, and time lines. For efficiency, these characteristic curves can be computed using standard approaches, by first transforming the input field accordingly. Finally, we prove that the input flow perceived by the observer field is objective. This makes derived flow features, such as vortices, objective as well.", "cite": 3, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Hadwiger,Markus", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}, {"id": "20"}, {"id": "21"}, {"id": "22"}, {"id": "23"}, {"id": "24"}, {"id": "25"}, {"id": "26"}, {"id": "27"}, {"id": "28"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "5", "target": "9"}, {"source": "5", "target": "10"}, {"source": "5", "target": "11"}, {"source": "5", "target": "12"}, {"source": "5", "target": "13"}, {"source": "5", "target": "14"}, {"source": "5", "target": "15"}, {"source": "5", "target": "16"}, {"source": "5", "target": "17"}, {"source": "5", "target": "18"}, {"source": "5", "target": "19"}, {"source": "5", "target": "20"}, {"source": "5", "target": "21"}, {"source": "5", "target": "22"}, {"source": "5", "target": "23"}, {"source": "5", "target": "24"}, {"source": "5", "target": "25"}, {"source": "5", "target": "26"}, {"source": "5", "target": "27"}, {"source": "5", "target": "28"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "8"}, {"source": "7", "target": "8"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Hadwiger,Markus", "1": "Beyer,Johanna", "2": "Mohammed,Haneen", "3": "Agus,Marco", "4": "Al-Awami,AliK.", "5": "Pfister,Hanspeter", "6": "Mlejnek,Matej", "7": "Theussl,Thomas", "8": "Rautek,Peter", "9": "Behrisch,Michael", "10": "Streeb,Dirk", "11": "Stoffel,Florian", "12": "Seebacher,Daniel", "13": "Matejek,Brian", "14": "Weber,StefanHagen", "15": "Mittelstaedt,Sebastian", "16": "Keim,Daniel", "17": "Strobelt,Hendrik", "18": "Gehrmann,Sebastian", "19": "Perer,Adam", "20": "Rush,AlexanderM.", "21": "Haehn,Daniel", "22": "Tompkin,James", "23": "Sicat,Ronell", "24": "Li,Jiabao", "25": "Choi,JunYoung", "26": "Cordeil,Maxime", "27": "Jeong,Won-Ki", "28": "Bach,Benjamin"}}
