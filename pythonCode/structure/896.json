Our framework, called Persistence Atlas, enables the visualization of the dominant spatial patterns of critical points, along with statistics regarding their occurrence in the ensemble. The persistence atlas represents in the geometrical domain each dominant pattern in the form of a confidence map for the appearance of critical points. As a by-product, our method also provides 2-dimensional layouts of the entire ensemble, highlighting the main trends at a global level. Our approach is based on the new notion of Persistence Map, a measure of the geometrical density in critical points which leverages the robustness to noise of topological persistence to better emphasize salient features. We show how to leverage spectral embedding to represent the ensemble members as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, where distances between points measure the dissimilarities between critical point layouts and where statistical tasks, such as clustering, can be easily carried out. Further, we show how the notion of mandatory critical point can be leveraged to evaluate for each cluster confidence regions for the appearance of critical points. Most of the steps of this framework can be trivially parallelized and we show how to efficiently implement them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the relevance of our approach. The accuracy of the confidence regions provided by the persistence atlas is quantitatively evaluated and compared to a baseline strategy using an off-the-shelf clustering approach. We illustrate the importance of the persistence atlas in a variety of real-life datasets, where clear trends in feature layouts are identified and analyzed. We provide a lightweight VTK-based C++ implementation of our approach that can be used for reproduction purposes.", "cite": 4, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Favelier,Guillaume", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Favelier,Guillaume", "1": "Faraj,Noura", "2": "Summa,Brian", "3": "Tierny,Julien"}}
