Accordingly, effective and accurate communication of information has become indispensable. In this work, we propose a content-based approach that automatically generates a clear and informative visual summarization based on design principles and cognitive psychology to represent image collections. We first introduce a novel method to make representative and nonredundant summarizations of image collections, thereby ensuring data cleanliness and emphasizing important information. Then, we propose a tree-based algorithm with a two-step optimization strategy to generate the final layout that operates as follows: (1) an initial layout is created by constructing a tree randomly based on the grouping results of the input image set; (2) the layout is refined through a coarse adjustment in a greedy manner, followed by gradient back propagation drawing on the training procedure of neural networks. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our method via extensive experimental results and user studies. Our visual summarization algorithm can precisely and efficiently capture the main content of image collections better than alternative methods or commercial tools.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "High Relief from Brush Painting", "author": ["Fu,Yunfei", "Yu,Hongchuan", "Yeh,Chih-Kuo", "Zhang,Jianjun", "Lee,Tong-Yee"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2860004", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Relief is an art form part way between 3D sculpture and 2D painting. We present a novel approach for generating a texture-mapped high-relief model from a single brush painting. Our aim is to extract the brushstrokes from a painting and generate the individual corresponding relief proxies rather than recovering the exact depth map from the painting, which is a tricky computer vision problem, requiring assumptions that are rarely satisfied. The relief proxies of brushstrokes are then combined together to form a 2.5D high-relief model. To extract brushstrokes from 2D paintings, we apply layer decomposition and stroke segmentation by imposing boundary constraints. The segmented brushstrokes preserve the style of the input painting. By inflation and a displacement map of each brushstroke, the features of brushstrokes are preserved by the resultant high-relief model of the painting. We demonstrate that our approach is able to produce convincing high-reliefs from a variety of paintings(with humans, animals, flowers, etc.). As a secondary application, we show how our brushstroke extraction algorithm could be used for image editing. As a result, our brushstroke extraction algorithm is specifically geared towards paintings with each brushstroke drawn very purposefully, such as Chinese paintings, Rosemailing paintings, etc.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Lee,Tong-Yee", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "0", "target": "10"}, {"source": "0", "target": "11"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "7"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "8", "target": "9"}, {"source": "8", "target": "10"}, {"source": "8", "target": "11"}, {"source": "9", "target": "10"}, {"source": "9", "target": "11"}, {"source": "10", "target": "11"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Lee,Tong-Yee", "1": "Pan,Xingjia", "2": "Tang,Fan", "3": "Dong,Weiming", "4": "Ma,Chongyang", "5": "Meng,Yiping", "6": "Huang,Feiyue", "7": "Xu,Changsheng", "8": "Fu,Yunfei", "9": "Yu,Hongchuan", "10": "Yeh,Chih-Kuo", "11": "Zhang,Jianjun"}}
