However, simulation of granular media is still challenging due to the complexity of granular materials and the large number of discrete solid particles. As we know, dry granular materials could form a hybrid state between a fluid and a solid, therefore we propose a two-layer model and divide the simulation domain into a dilute layer, where granules can move freely as a fluid, and a dense layer, where granules act more like a solid. Motivated by the shallow water equations, we derive a set of shallow sand equations for modeling dry granular flows by depth-integrating three-dimensional governing equations along its vertical direction. Unlike previous methods for simulating a 2D granular media, our model does not restrict the depth of the granular media to be shallow anymore. To allow efficient fluid-solid interactions, we also present a ray casting algorithm for one-way solid-fluid coupling. Finally, we introduce a particle-tracking method to improve the visual representation. Our method can be efficiently implemented based on a height field and is fully compatible with modern GPUs, therefore allows us to simulate large-scale dry granular flows in real time.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Wang,Hongan", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Wang,Hongan", "1": "Zhu,Kuixin", "2": "He,Xiaowei", "3": "Li,Sheng", "4": "Wang,Guoping", "5": "Hu,Zhiming", "6": "Zhang,Congyi", "7": "Manocha,Dinesh"}}
