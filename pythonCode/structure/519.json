The algorithm uses multiple criteria decision making, based on fuzzy logic, to optimize positions of the labels associated with different parts of the input model. The proposed method can be used with various existing algorithms for creating ghosted views from 3D models. The method operates in real-time, which allows the user to acquire a good understanding of the structure of the input model by studying the model and its labels from different viewpoints. We have conducted a user study to evaluate label layouts produced by our algorithm and those created by humans. The results show that the proposed method can significantly improve user understanding of labeled ghosted views of complicated 3D models, and its label layouts are comparable with label layouts created by humans.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Bittner,Jiri", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "7"}, {"source": "1", "target": "8"}, {"source": "1", "target": "9"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Bittner,Jiri", "1": "Cmolik,Ladislav", "2": "Kouril,David", "3": "Kozlikova,Barbora", "4": "Wu,Hsiang-Yun", "5": "Johnson,Graham", "6": "Goodsell,DavidS.", "7": "Olson,Arthur", "8": "Groller,M.Eduard", "9": "Viola,Ivan"}}
