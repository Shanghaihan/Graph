The principal idea is to time-multiplex virtual imagery and real-world imagery and use a tunable lens to adjust focus for the virtual display and the see-through scene separately. With this novel design, prescription eyeglasses for near- and far-sighted users become unnecessary. This is achieved by integrating the wearer's corrective optical prescription into the tunable lens for both virtual display and see-through environment. We built a prototype based on the design, comprised of micro-display, optical systems, a tunable lens, and active shutters. The experimental results confirm that the proposed near-eye display design can switch between AR and VR and can provide correct accommodation for both.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Varifocal Occlusion-Capable Optical See-through Augmented Reality Display based on Focus-tunable Optics", "author": ["Rathinavel,Kishore", "Wetzstein,Gordon", "Fuchs,Henry"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2019.2933120", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Optical see-through augmented reality (AR) systems are a next-generation computing platform that offer unprecedented user experiences by seamlessly combining physical and digital content. Many of the traditional challenges of these displays have been significantly improved over the last few years. but AR experiences offered by today's systems are far from seamless and perceptually realistic. Mutually consistent occlusions between physical and digital objects are typically not supported. When mutual occlusion is supported, it is only supported for a fixed depth. We propose a new optical see-through AR display system that renders mutual occlusion in a depth-dependent, perceptually realistic manner. To this end, we introduce varifocal occlusion displays based on focus-tunable optics, which comprise a varifocal lens system and spatial light modulators that enable depth-corrected hard-edge occlusions for AR experiences. We derive formal optimization methods and closed-form solutions for driving this tunable lens system and demonstrate a monocular varifocal occlusion-capable optical see-through AR display capable of perceptually realistic occlusion across a large depth range.", "cite": 4, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Manufacturing Application-Driven Foveated Near-Eye Displays", "author": ["Aksit,Kaan", "Chakravarthula,Praneeth", "Rathinavel,Kishore", "Jeong,Youngmo", "Albert,Rachel", "Fuchs,Henry", "Luebke,David"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2019.2898781", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Traditional optical manufacturing poses a great challenge to near-eye display designers due to large lead times in the order of multiple weeks. limiting the abilities of optical designers to iterate fast and explore beyond conventional designs.

The instrument uses high-intensity infrared emitters and two duo-lateral photodiode-based optical sensors to triangulate pose. This instrument serves two purposes: it is the first step towards the requisite head tracking component in sub-100 mu s motion-to-photon latency optical see-through augmented reality (OST AR) head-mounted display (HMD) systems; and it enables new avenues of research into human visual perception - including measuring the thresholds for perceptible real-virtual displacement during head rotation and other human research requiring high-sample-rate motion tracking. The instrument's tracking volume is limited to about 120x120x250mm but allows for the full range of natural head rotation and is sufficient for research involving seated users. We discuss how the instrument's tracking volume is scalable in multiple ways and some of the trade-offs involved therein. Finally, we introduce a novel laser-pointer-based measurement technique for assessing the instrument's tracking latency and repeatability.
