Medical studies assume a strong relation between the progression and rupture of aneurysms and flow patterns. To understand how flow patterns impact the vessel morphology, they are manually classified according to predefined classes. However, manual classifications are time-consuming and exhibit a high inter-observer variability. In contrast, our approach is more objective and faster than manual methods. The classification of integral lines, representing steady or unsteady blood flow, is based on a mapping of the aneurysm surface to a hemisphere by calculating polar-based coordinates. The lines are clustered and for each cluster a representative is calculated. Then, the polar-based coordinates are transformed to the representative as basis for the classification. Classes are based on the flow complexity. The classification results are presented by a detail-on-demand approach using a visual transition from the representative over an enclosing surface to the associated lines. Based on seven representative datasets, we conduct an informal interview with five domain experts to evaluate the system. They confirmed that CAVOCLA allows for a robust classification of intra-aneurysmal flow patterns. The detail-on-demand visualization enables an efficient exploration and interpretation of flow patterns.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Comparison of Projective Augmented Reality Concepts to Support Medical Needle Insertion", "author": ["Heinrich,Florian", "Joeres,Fabian", "Lawonn,Kai", "Hansen,Christian"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2019.2903942", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) is a promising tool to improve instrument navigation in needle-based interventions. Limited research has been conducted regarding suitable navigation visualizations. In this work, three navigation concepts based on existing approaches were compared in a user study using a projective AR setup. Each concept was implemented with three different scales for accuracy-to-color mapping and two methods of navigation indicator scaling. Participants were asked to perform simulated needle insertion tasks with each of the resulting 18 prototypes. Insertion angle and insertion depth accuracies were measured and analyzed, as well as task completion time and participants' subjectively perceived task difficulty. Results show a clear ranking of visualization concepts across variables. Less consistent results were obtained for the color and indicator scaling factors. Results suggest that logarithmic indicator scaling achieved better accuracy, but participants perceived it to be more difficult than linear scaling. With specific results for angle and depth accuracy, our study contributes to the future composition of improved navigation support and systems for precise needle insertion or similar applications.", "cite": 4, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Visual Analysis of Aneurysm Data using Statistical Graphics", "author": ["Meuschke,Monique", "Gunther,Tobias", "Berg,Philipp", "Wickenhoefer,Ralph", "Preim,Bernhard", "Lawonn,Kai"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864509", "keywords": "", "abstract": "This paper presents a framework to explore multi-field data of aneurysms occurring at intracranial and cardiac arteries by using statistical graphics. The rupture of an aneurysm is often a fatal scenario, whereas during treatment serious complications for the patient can occur. Whether an aneurysm ruptures or whether a treatment is successful depends on the interaction of different morphological such as wall deformation and thickness, and hemodynamic attributes like wall shear stress and pressure. Therefore, medical researchers are very interested in better understanding these relationships. However, the required analysis is a time-consuming process, where suspicious wall regions are difficult to detect due to the time-dependent behavior of the data. Our proposed visualization framework enables medical researchers to efficiently assess aneurysm risk and treatment options. This comprises a powerful set of views including 2D and 3D depictions of the aneurysm morphology as well as statistical plots of different scalar fields. Brushing and linking aids the user to identify interesting wall regions and to understand the influence of different attributes on the aneurysm's state. Moreover, a visual comparison of pre- and post-treatment as well as different treatment options is provided. Our analysis techniques are designed in collaboration with domain experts, e.g., physicians, and we provide details about the evaluation.", "cite": 2, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Lawonn,Kai", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "0", "target": "10"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "8"}, {"source": "1", "target": "9"}, {"source": "1", "target": "10"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "4", "target": "11"}, {"source": "4", "target": "12"}, {"source": "4", "target": "13"}, {"source": "4", "target": "14"}, {"source": "4", "target": "8"}, {"source": "4", "target": "9"}, {"source": "4", "target": "10"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "8", "target": "9"}, {"source": "8", "target": "10"}, {"source": "9", "target": "10"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Lawonn,Kai", "1": "Meuschke,Monique", "2": "Oeltze-Jafra,Steffen", "3": "Beuing,Oliver", "4": "Preim,Bernhard", "5": "Heinrich,Florian", "6": "Joeres,Fabian", "7": "Hansen,Christian", "8": "Gunther,Tobias", "9": "Berg,Philipp", "10": "Wickenhoefer,Ralph", "11": "Schmidt,Johanna", "12": "Fleischmann,Dominik", "13": "Braendle,Norbert", "14": "Mistelbauer,Gabriel"}}
