However, existing techniques typically combine all the example deformation modes, which can lead to overfitting, i.e. using an overly complicated model to explain the user-specified deformation. This leads to implausible or unstable deformation results, including unexpected global changes outside the region of interest. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a sparse blending method that automatically selects a smaller number of deformation modes to compactly describe the desired deformation. This along with a suitably chosen deformation basis including spatially localized deformation modes leads to significant advantages, including more meaningful, reliable, and efficient deformations because fewer and localized deformation modes are applied. To cope with large rotations, we develop a simple but effective representation based on polar decomposition of deformation gradients, which resolves the ambiguity of large global rotations using an as-consistent-as-possible global optimization. This simple representation has a closed form solution for derivatives, making it efficient for our sparse localized representation and thus ensuring interactive performance. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven mesh deformation methods, for both quality of results and efficiency.", "cite": 3, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Temporal Upsampling of Depth Maps Using a Hybrid Camera", "author": ["Yuan,Ming-Ze", "Gao,Lin", "Fu,Hongbo", "Xia,Shihong"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2812879", "keywords": "", "abstract": "In recent years, consumer-level depth cameras have been adopted for various applications. However, they often produce depth maps at only a moderately high frame rate (approximately 30 frames per second), preventing them from being used for applications such as digitizing human performance involving fast motion. On the other hand, low-cost, high-frame-rate video cameras are available. This motivates us to develop a hybrid camera that consists of a high-frame-rate video camera and a low-frame-rate depth camera and to allow temporal interpolation of depth maps with the help of auxiliary color images. To achieve this, we develop a novel algorithm that reconstructs intermediate depth maps and estimates scene flow simultaneously. We test our algorithm on various examples involving fast, non-rigid motions of single or multiple objects. Our experiments show that our scene flow estimation method is more precise than a tracking-based method and the state-of-the-art techniques.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Gao,Lin", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}, {"id": "20"}, {"id": "21"}, {"id": "22"}, {"id": "23"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "1", "target": "8"}, {"source": "1", "target": "9"}, {"source": "1", "target": "10"}, {"source": "1", "target": "11"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "12"}, {"source": "1", "target": "13"}, {"source": "1", "target": "14"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "15"}, {"source": "4", "target": "16"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "7", "target": "17"}, {"source": "7", "target": "18"}, {"source": "7", "target": "19"}, {"source": "7", "target": "20"}, {"source": "7", "target": "21"}, {"source": "7", "target": "22"}, {"source": "7", "target": "23"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Gao,Lin", "1": "Lai,Yu-Kun", "2": "Yang,Jie", "3": "Ling-Xiao,Zhang", "4": "Xia,Shihong", "5": "Kobbelt,Leif", "6": "Yuan,Ming-Ze", "7": "Fu,Hongbo", "8": "Zhang,Suiyun", "9": "Han,Zhizhong", "10": "Zwicker,Matthias", "11": "Zhang,Hui", "12": "Li,Kun", "13": "Yang,Jingyu", "14": "Guo,Daoliang", "15": "Wang,Zhiyong", "16": "Chai,Jinxiang", "17": "Xu,Pengfei", "18": "Yan,Guohang", "19": "Igarashi,Takeo", "20": "Tai,Chiew-Lan", "21": "Huang,Hui", "22": "Zheng,Youyi", "23": "Singh,Karan"}}
