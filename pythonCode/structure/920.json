Typically studies focus on short tasks and use static expected areas of interest (Aol) in the display to explore subjects' behaviour, making the analyst's task quite straightforward. In long-duration studies, where the observations may last several hours over a complete work session, the Aols may change over time in response to altering workload, emergencies or other variables making the analysis more difficult. This work puts forward a novel method to automatically identify spatial Aols changing over time through a combination of clustering and cluster merging in the temporal domain. A visual analysis system based on the proposed methods is also presented. Finally, we illustrate our approach within the domain of air traffic control, a complex task sensitive to prevailing conditions over long durations, though it is applicable to other domains such as monitoring of complex systems.", "cite": 3, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Muthumanickam,PrithivirajK.", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Muthumanickam,PrithivirajK.", "1": "Vrotsou,Katerina", "2": "Nordman,Aida", "3": "Johansson,Jimmy", "4": "Cooper,Matthew"}}
