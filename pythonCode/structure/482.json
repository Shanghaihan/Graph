To provide an overview of the relevant techniques and analysis tasks, as well as the relationships between them, we comprehensively analyzed 263 visualization papers and 4,346 mining papers published between 1992-2017 in two fields: visualization and text mining. From the analysis, we derived around 300 concepts (visualization techniques, mining techniques, and analysis tasks) and built a taxonomy for each type of concept. The co-occurrence relationships between the concepts were also extracted. Our research can be used as a stepping-stone for other researchers to 1) understand a common set of concepts used in this research topic; 2) facilitate the exploration of the relationships between visualization techniques, mining techniques, and analysis tasks; 3) understand the current practice in developing visual text analytics tools; 4) seek potential research opportunities by narrowing the gulf between visualization and mining techniques based on the analysis tasks; and 5) analyze other interdisciplinary research areas in a similar way. We have also contributed a web-based visualization tool for analyzing and understanding research trends and opportunities in visual text analytics.", "cite": 11, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "MotionRugs: Visualizing Collective Trends in Space and Time", "author": ["Buchmueller,Jun", "Jaeckie,Dominik", "Cakmak,Eren", "Brandes,Ulrik", "Keim,DanielA."], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865049", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Understanding the movement patterns of collectives, such as flocks of birds or fish swarms, is an interesting open research question. The collectives are driven by mutual objectives or react to individual direction changes and external influence factors and stimuli. The challenge in visualizing collective movement data is to show space and time of hundreds of movements at the same time to enable the detection of spatio temporal patterns. In this paper, we propose MotionRugs, a novel space efficient technique for visualizing moving groups of entities. Building upon established space-partitioning strategies, our approach reduces the spatial dimensions in each time step to a one-dimensional ordered representation of the individual entities. By design, MotionRugs provides an overlap-free, compact overview of the development of group movements over time and thus, enables analysts to visually identify and explore group-specific temporal patterns. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in the field of fish swarm analysis and report on initial feedback of domain experts from the field of collective behavior.", "cite": 6, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "VIS4ML: An Ontology for Visual Analytics Assisted Machine Learning", "author": ["Sacha,Dominik", "Kraus,Matthias", "Keim,DanielA.", "Chen,Min"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864838", "keywords": "", "abstract": "While many VA workflows make use of machine-learned models to support analytical tasks. VA workflows have become increasingly important in understanding and improving Machine Learning (ML) processes. In this paper. we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely \"VA-assisted ML'. The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly.", "cite": 18, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Keim,DanielA.", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}, {"id": "20"}, {"id": "21"}, {"id": "22"}, {"id": "23"}, {"id": "24"}, {"id": "25"}, {"id": "26"}, {"id": "27"}, {"id": "28"}, {"id": "29"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "0", "target": "10"}, {"source": "0", "target": "11"}, {"source": "0", "target": "12"}, {"source": "0", "target": "13"}, {"source": "0", "target": "14"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "7"}, {"source": "1", "target": "15"}, {"source": "1", "target": "16"}, {"source": "1", "target": "17"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "18"}, {"source": "3", "target": "19"}, {"source": "3", "target": "20"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "7"}, {"source": "5", "target": "15"}, {"source": "5", "target": "16"}, {"source": "5", "target": "17"}, {"source": "6", "target": "21"}, {"source": "6", "target": "20"}, {"source": "6", "target": "14"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "18"}, {"source": "6", "target": "19"}, {"source": "8", "target": "9"}, {"source": "8", "target": "10"}, {"source": "8", "target": "11"}, {"source": "9", "target": "10"}, {"source": "9", "target": "11"}, {"source": "10", "target": "11"}, {"source": "12", "target": "13"}, {"source": "12", "target": "14"}, {"source": "13", "target": "14"}, {"source": "14", "target": "22"}, {"source": "14", "target": "23"}, {"source": "14", "target": "24"}, {"source": "14", "target": "25"}, {"source": "14", "target": "26"}, {"source": "14", "target": "21"}, {"source": "14", "target": "20"}, {"source": "14", "target": "27"}, {"source": "14", "target": "28"}, {"source": "14", "target": "29"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Keim,DanielA.", "1": "Liu,Shixia", "2": "Wang,Xiting", "3": "Collins,Christopher", "4": "Dou,Wenwen", "5": "Ouyang,Fangxin", "6": "El-Assady,Mennatallah", "7": "Jiang,Liu", "8": "Buchmueller,Jun", "9": "Jaeckie,Dominik", "10": "Cakmak,Eren", "11": "Brandes,Ulrik", "12": "Sacha,Dominik", "13": "Kraus,Matthias", "14": "Chen,Min", "15": "Chen,Changjian", "16": "Lu,Yafeng", "17": "Wang,Bin", "18": "Sperrle,Fabian", "19": "Deussen,Oliver", "20": "Keim,Daniel", "21": "Streeb,Dirk", "22": "Nardini,Pascal", "23": "Samsel,Francesca", "24": "Bujack,Roxana", "25": "Bottinger,Michael", "26": "Scheuermann,Gerik", "27": "Gaither,Kelly", "28": "John,NigelW.", "29": "McCann,Brian"}}
