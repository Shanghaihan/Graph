While it is often sufficient to explore only the summary statistics of a dataset (e.g., min/mean/max), Anscombe's Quartet demonstrates how such statistics can be misleading. We consider a similar problem in the context of graph mining. To study the relationships between different graph properties and summary statistics, we examine low-order non-isomorphic graphs and provide a simple visual analytics system to explore correlations across multiple graph properties. However, for larger graphs, studying the entire space quickly becomes intractable. We use different random graph generation methods to further look into the distribution of graph properties for higher order graphs and investigate the impact of various sampling methodologies. We also describe a method for generating many graphs that are identical over a number of graph properties and statistics yet are clearly different and identifiably distinct.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Guest Editors' Introduction: Special Section on IEEE PacificVis 2019", "author": ["Maciejewski,Ross", "Seo,Jinwook", "Westermann,Rudiger"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2019.2905484", "keywords": "", "abstract": " AU Maciejewski, Ross Seo, Jinwook Westermann, Rudiger TI Guest Editors' Introduction: Special Section on IEEE PacificVis 2019 SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS VL 25 IS 6 BP 2155 EP 2156 DI 10.1109/TVCG.2019.2905484 PD JUN 2019 PY 2019", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "A Visual Analytics Framework for Spatiotemporal Trade Network Analysis", "author": ["Wang,Hong", "Lu,Yafeng", "Shutters,ShadeT.", "Steptoe,Michael", "Wang,Feng", "Landis,Steven", "Maciejewski,Ross"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864844", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Economic globalization is increasing connectedness among regions of the world, creating complex interdependencies within various supply chains. Recent studies have indicated that changes and disruptions within such networks can serve as indicators for increased risks of violence and armed conflicts. This is especially true of countries that may not be able to compete for scarce commodities during supply shocks. Thus, network-induced vulnerability to supply disruption is typically exported from wealthier populations to disadvantaged populations. As such, researchers and stakeholders concerned with supply chains, political science, environmental studies, etc. need tools to explore the complex dynamics within global trade networks and how the structure of these networks relates to regional instability. However, the multivariate, spatiotemporal nature of the network structure creates a bottleneck in the extraction and analysis of correlations and anomalies for exploratory data analysis and hypothesis generation. Working closely with experts in political science and sustainability, we have developed a highly coordinated, multi-view framework that utilizes anomaly detection, network analytics, and spatiotemporal visualization methods for exploring the relationship between global trade networks and regional instability. Requirements for analysis and initial research questions to be investigated are elicited from domain experts, and a variety of visual encoding techniques for rapid assessment of analysis and correlations between trade goods, network patterns, and time series signatures are explored. We demonstrate the application of our framework through case studies focusing on armed conflicts in Africa. regional instability measures, and their relationship to international global trade.", "cite": 1, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Maciejewski,Ross", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}, {"id": "20"}, {"id": "21"}, {"id": "22"}, {"id": "23"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "0", "target": "10"}, {"source": "0", "target": "11"}, {"source": "0", "target": "12"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "13"}, {"source": "3", "target": "14"}, {"source": "3", "target": "15"}, {"source": "3", "target": "16"}, {"source": "3", "target": "8"}, {"source": "3", "target": "9"}, {"source": "3", "target": "10"}, {"source": "3", "target": "11"}, {"source": "3", "target": "12"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "6", "target": "17"}, {"source": "6", "target": "18"}, {"source": "6", "target": "19"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "8", "target": "9"}, {"source": "8", "target": "10"}, {"source": "8", "target": "11"}, {"source": "8", "target": "12"}, {"source": "9", "target": "10"}, {"source": "9", "target": "11"}, {"source": "9", "target": "12"}, {"source": "10", "target": "11"}, {"source": "10", "target": "12"}, {"source": "11", "target": "12"}, {"source": "11", "target": "20"}, {"source": "11", "target": "21"}, {"source": "11", "target": "22"}, {"source": "11", "target": "23"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Maciejewski,Ross", "1": "Chen,Hang", "2": "Kobourov,StephenG", "3": "Lu,Yafeng", "4": "Huroyan,Vahan", "5": "Soni,Utkarsh", "6": "Seo,Jinwook", "7": "Westermann,Rudiger", "8": "Wang,Hong", "9": "Shutters,ShadeT.", "10": "Steptoe,Michael", "11": "Wang,Feng", "12": "Landis,Steven", "13": "Liu,Shixia", "14": "Chen,Changjian", "15": "Ouyang,Fangxin", "16": "Wang,Bin", "17": "Jo,Jaemin", "18": "Lyi,Sehi", "19": "Lee,Bongshin", "20": "Wald,Ingo", "21": "Wu,Qi", "22": "Usher,Will", "23": "Johnson,ChrisR."}}
