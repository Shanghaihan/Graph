For achieving this objective, we propose an approach that includes a combination of query techniques for flexible selection of episodes of situation development, a method for dynamic aggregation of data from selected groups of episodes, and a data structure for representing the aggregates that enables their exploration and use in further analysis. The aggregation, which is meant to abstract general movement patterns, involves construction of new time-homomorphic reference systems owing to iterative application of aggregation operators to a sequence of data selections. As similar patterns may occur at different spatial locations, we also propose constructing new spatial reference systems for aligning and matching movements irrespective of their absolute locations. The approach was tested in application to tracking data from two Bundesliga games of the 2018/2019 season. It enabled detection of interesting and meaningful general patterns of team behaviors in three classes of situations defined by football experts. The experts found the approach and the underlying concepts worth implementing in tools for football analysts.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Understanding User Behaviour through Action Sequences: From the Usual to the Unusual", "author": ["Nguyen,PhongH.", "Turkay,Cagatay", "Andrienko,Gennady", "Andrienko,Natalia", "Thonnard,Olivier", "Zouaoui,Jihane"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2859969", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Action sequences, where atomic user actions are represented in a labelled, timestamped form, are becoming a fundamental data asset in the inspection and monitoring of user behaviour in digital systems.

This paper presents a visual analytics approach that aims to facilitate a user-involved, multi-faceted decision making process during the identification and the investigation of \"unusual\" action sequences. We first report the results of the task analysis and domain characterisation process. Then we describe the components of our multi-level analysis approach that comprises of constraint-based sequential pattern mining and semantic distance based clustering, and multi-scalar visualisations of users and their sequences. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach through a case study that involves tasks requiring effective decision-making by a group of domain experts.

There have been many studies focusing on finding and analyzing various kinds of events in time series; the term 'event' refers to significant changes or occurrences of particular patterns formed by consecutive attribute values. We focus on a further step in event analysis: discover temporal relationship patterns between event locations, i.e., repeated cases when there is a specific temporal relationship (same time, before, or after) between events occurring at two locations. This can provide important clues for understanding the formation and spreading mechanisms of events and interdependencies among spatial locations. We propose a visual exploration framework COPE (Co-Occurrence Pattern Exploration), which allows users to extract events of interest from data and detect various co-occurrence patterns among them.
