Many of these systems have been developed with rich interactions, offering users the opportunity to examine details and explore hypotheses that have not been directly encoded by a designer. Understanding is enhanced when users can replay and revisit the steps in the sensemaking process, and in collaborative settings, it is especially important to be able to review not only the current state but also what decisions were made along the way. Unfortunately, many web-based systems lack the ability to capture such reasoning, and the path to a result is transient, forgotten when a user moves to a new view. This paper explores the requirements to augment existing client-side web applications with support for capturing, reviewing, sharing, and reusing steps in the reasoning process. Furthermore, it considers situations where decisions are made with streaming data, and the insights gained from revisiting those choices when more data is available. It presents a proof of concept, the Shareable Interactive Manipulation Provenance framework (SIMProv.js), that addresses these requirements in a modern, client-side JavaScript library, and describes how it can be integrated with existing frameworks.", "cite": 3, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Koop,David", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "8"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Koop,David", "1": "Camisetty,Akhilesh", "2": "Chandurkar,Chaitanya", "3": "Sun,Maoyuan", "4": "Zhao,Jian", "5": "Wu,Hao", "6": "Luther,Kurt", "7": "North,Chris", "8": "Ramakrishnan,Naren"}}
