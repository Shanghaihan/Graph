Unfortunately, they usually rely on 3D volumes or fiber meshes that are not only data-intensive but also expensive to render. Traditional surface-based models, on the other hand, are light-weight and fast to render but normally lack the fidelity and details important for design and prototyping applications. We introduce a multi-scale, hybrid model to bridge this gap for thin fabrics. Our model enjoys both the compactness and speedy rendering offered by traditional surface-based models and the rich details provided by the micro-appearance models. Further, we propose a new algorithm to convert state-of-the-art micro-appearance models into our representation while qualitatively preserving the detailed appearance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by integrating it into a real-time rendering system.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Xu,Chao", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "8"}, {"source": "3", "target": "9"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Xu,Chao", "1": "Wang,Rui", "2": "Zhao,Shuang", "3": "Bao,Hujun", "4": "Feng,Xudong", "5": "Liu,Jiafeng", "6": "Yang,Yin", "7": "Wang,Huamin", "8": "Bickel,Bernd", "9": "Xu,Weiwei"}}
