To identify performance bottlenecks, programmers and performance analysts visually explore CCTs to form and validate hypotheses regarding degraded performance.

We present CALLFLOW, an interactive visual analysis tool that provides a high-level overview of CCTs together with semantic refinement operations to progressively explore the CCTs. Using a flow-based metaphor, we visualize a CCT by treating execution time as a resource spent during a call chain, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our design with case studies on large-scale, production simulation codes.", "cite": 2, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "NLIZE: A Perturbation-Driven Visual Interrogation Tool for Analyzing and Interpreting Natural Language Inference Models", "author": ["Liu,Shusen", "Li,Zhimin", "Li,Tao", "Srikumar,Vivek", "Pascucci,Valerio", "Bremer,Peer-Timo"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865230", "keywords": "", "abstract": "With the recent advances in deep learning, neural network models have obtained state-of-the-art performances for many linguistic tasks in natural language processing.

Here, we introduce a visualization system that, through a tight yet flexible integration between visualization elements and the underlying model, allows a user to interrogate the model by perturbing the input, internal state, and prediction while observing changes in other parts of the pipeline. We use the natural language inference problem as an example to illustrate how a perturbation-driven paradigm can help domain experts assess the potential limitation of a model, probe its inner states, and interpret and form hypotheses about fundamental model mechanisms such as attention.", "cite": 7, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Shared-Memory Parallel Computation of Morse-Smale Complexes with Improved Accuracy", "author": ["Gyulassy,Attila", "Bremer,Peer-Timo", "Pascucci,Valerio"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864848", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Topological techniques have proven to be a powerful tool in the analysis and visualization of large-scale scientific data. In particular, the Morse-Smale complex and its various components provide a rich framework for robust feature definition and computation. Consequently, there now exist a number of approaches to compute Morse-Smale complexes for large-scale data in parallel. However, existing techniques are based on discrete concepts which produce the correct topological structure but are known to introduce grid artifacts in the resulting geometry. Here, we present a new approach that combines parallel streamline computation with combinatorial methods to construct a high-quality discrete Morse-Smale complex. In addition to being invariant to the orientation of the underlying grid, this algorithm allows users to selectively build a subset of features using high-quality geometry. In particular, a user may specifically select which ascending/descending manifolds are reconstructed with improved accuracy, focusing computational effort where it matters for subsequent analysis. This approach computes Morse-Smale complexes for larger data than previously feasible with significant speedups. We demonstrate and validate our approach using several examples from a variety of different scientific domains, and evaluate the performance of our method.", "cite": 3, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "A Study of the Trade-off Between Reducing Precision and Reducing Resolution for Data Analysis and Visualization", "author": ["DuongHoang", "Klacansky,Pavol", "Bhatia,Harsh", "Bremer,Peer-Timo", "Lindstrom,Peter", "Pascucci,Valerio"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864853", "keywords": "", "abstract": "There currently exist two dominant strategies to reduce data sizes in analysis and visualization: reducing the precision of the data, e.g.. through quantization, or reducing its resolution, e.g., by subsampling. Both have advantages and disadvantages and both face fundamental limits at which the reduced information ceases to be useful. The paper explores the additional gains that could be achieved by combining both strategies. In particular, we present a common framework that allows us to study the trade-off in reducing precision and/or resolution in a principled manner. We represent data reduction schemes as progressive streams of bits and study how various bit orderings such as by resolution, by precision, etc., impact the resulting approximation error across a variety of data sets as well as analysis tasks. Furthermore. we compute streams that are optimized for different tasks to serve as lower bounds on the achievable error.
