Despite its potential benefits, intermediate knowledge from progressive analytics can be incorrect due to various machine and human factors, such as a sampling bias or misinterpretation of uncertainty. To alleviate this problem, we introduce PVA-Guards, safeguards people can leave on uncertain intermediate knowledge that needs to be verified, and derive seven PVA-Guards based on previous visualization task taxonomies. PVA-Guards provide a means of ensuring the correctness of the conclusion and understanding the reason when intermediate knowledge becomes invalid. We also present ProReveal, a proof-of-concept system designed and developed to integrate the seven safeguards into progressive data exploration. Finally, we report a user study with 14 participants, which show people voluntarily employed PVA-Guards to safeguard their findings and ProReveal's PVA-Guard view provides an overview of uncertain intermediate knowledge. We believe our new concept can also offer better consistency in progressive data exploration, alleviating people's heterogeneous interpretation of uncertainty.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "A Declarative Rendering Model for Multiclass Density Maps", "author": ["Jo,Jaemin", "Vernier,Frederic", "Dragicevic,Pierre", "Fekete,Jean-Daniel"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865141", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Multiclass maps are scatterplots, multidimensional projections, or thematic geographic maps where data points have a categorical attribute in addition to two quantitative attributes. This categorical attribute is often rendered using shape or color, which does not scale when overplotting occurs. When the number of data points increases, multiclass maps must resort to data aggregation to remain readable. We present multiclass density maps: multiple 2D histograms computed for each of the category values. Multiclass density maps are meant as a building block to improve the expressiveness and scalability of multiclass map visualization. In this article, we first present a short survey of aggregated multiclass maps, mainly from cartography. We then introduce a declarative model a simple yet expressive JSON grammar associated with visual semantics that specifies a wide design space of visualizations for multiclass density maps. Our declarative model is expressive and can be efficiently implemented in visualization front-ends such as modern web browsers. Furthermore, it can be reconfigured dynamically to support data exploration tasks without recomputing the raw data. Finally, we demonstrate how our model can be used to reproduce examples from the past and support exploring data at scale.", "cite": 5, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Jo,Jaemin", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}, {"id": "20"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "7"}, {"source": "2", "target": "8"}, {"source": "2", "target": "9"}, {"source": "2", "target": "10"}, {"source": "2", "target": "11"}, {"source": "2", "target": "12"}, {"source": "2", "target": "13"}, {"source": "3", "target": "14"}, {"source": "3", "target": "15"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "16"}, {"source": "5", "target": "17"}, {"source": "5", "target": "18"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "6", "target": "19"}, {"source": "6", "target": "20"}, {"source": "6", "target": "8"}, {"source": "6", "target": "16"}, {"source": "6", "target": "17"}, {"source": "6", "target": "18"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Jo,Jaemin", "1": "Lyi,Sehi", "2": "Lee,Bongshin", "3": "Seo,Jinwook", "4": "Vernier,Frederic", "5": "Dragicevic,Pierre", "6": "Fekete,Jean-Daniel", "7": "Brehmer,Matthew", "8": "Isenberg,Petra", "9": "Choe,EunKyoung", "10": "Blascheck,Tanja", "11": "Besancon,Lonni", "12": "Bezerianos,Anastasia", "13": "Ren,Donghao", "14": "Maciejewski,Ross", "15": "Westermann,Rudiger", "16": "LeGoc,Mathieu", "17": "Perin,Charles", "18": "Follmer,Sean", "19": "Tovanich,Natkamon", "20": "Heulot,Nicolas"}}
