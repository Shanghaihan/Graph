These extremely large images contain networks that are highly complex, time consuming to segment, and difficult to visualize. In this paper, we present a framework for segmenting and visualizing vascular networks from terabyte-sized three-dimensional images collected using high-throughput microscopy. While these images require terabytes of storage, the volume devoted to the fiber network is approximate to 4 percent of the total volume size. While the networks themselves are sparse, they are tremendously complex, interconnected, and vary widely in diameter. We describe a parallel GPU-based predictor-corrector method for tracing filaments that is robust to noise and sampling errors common in these data sets. We also propose a number of visualization techniques designed to convey the complex statistical descriptions of fibers across large tissue sections-including commonly studied microvascular characteristics, such as orientation and volume.", "cite": 2, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Womack,Tasha", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "8"}, {"source": "3", "target": "9"}, {"source": "3", "target": "10"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Womack,Tasha", "1": "Govyadinov,PavelA.", "2": "Eriksen,JasonL.", "3": "Chen,Guoning", "4": "Mayerich,David", "5": "Shi,Lieyu", "6": "SLaramee,Robert", "7": "Xu,Kaoji", "8": "Berenjkoub,Marzieh", "9": "Monico,RodolfoOstilla", "10": "Laramee,RobertS."}}
