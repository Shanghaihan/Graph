A PSLM is a programmable reflective device that can selectively retardate, or delay, the incoming light rays. As a result, a PSLM works as a computational dynamic lens device. We demonstrate our computational phase-modulated eyeglasses with either a single PSLM or dual PSLMs and show that the concept can realize various optical operations including focus correction, bi-focus, image shift, and field of view manipulation, namely optical zoom. Compared to other programmable optics, computational phase-modulated eyeglasses have the advantage in terms of its versatility. In addition, we also presents some prototypical focus-loop applications where the lens is dynamically optimized based on distances of objects observed by a scene camera.

In this work we present a system that provides immersive telepresence and remote collaboration on mobile and wearable devices by building a live spherical panoramic representation of a user's environment that can be viewed in real time by a remote user who can independently choose the viewing direction. The remote user can then interact with this environment as if they were actually there through intuitive gesture-based interaction. Each user can obtain independent views within this environment by rotating their device, and their current field of view is shared to allow for simple coordination of viewpoints. We present several different approaches to create this shared live environment and discuss their implementation details, individual challenges, and performance on modern mobile hardware; by doing so we provide key insights into the design and implementation of next generation mobile telepresence systems, guiding future research in this domain.

Existing optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs) form virtual images in an additive manner-they optically combine the light from an embedded light source such as a microdisplay into the users' field of view (FoV). Instead, our light attenuation display filters the color of the real background light pixel-wise in the users' see-through view. resulting in an image as a spatial color filter. Our image formation is complementary to existing light-additive OST-HMDs. The core optical component in our system is a phase-only spatial light modulator (PSLM). a liquid crystal module that can control the phase of the light in each pixel. By combining PSLMs with polarization optics, our system realizes a spatially programmable color filter.
