In this paper, we present a component model design for data visualization to promote modular designs of visualization tools that enhance their analytical scope. Rather than fragmenting tasks across tools, the component model supports unification, where components the building blocks of this model can be assembled to support a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, the model also provides additional key properties, such as support for collaboration, sharing across multiple devices, and adaptive usage depending on expertise, from creating visualizations using dropdown menus, through instantiating components, to actually modifying components or creating entirely new ones from scratch using JavaScript or Python source code. To realize our model, we introduce VISTRATES, a literate computing platform for developing. assembling, and sharing visualization components. From a visualization perspective, Vistrates features cross-cutting components for visual representations, interaction, collaboration, and device responsiveness maintained in a component repository. From a development perspective. Vistrates offers a collaborative programming environment where novices and experts alike can compose component pipelines for specific analytical activities. Finally, we present several Vistrates use cases that span the full range of the classic \"anytime\" and \"anywhere\" motto for ubiquitous analysis: from mobile and on-the-go usage, through office settings, to collaborative smart environments covering a variety of tasks and devices.", "cite": 6, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Elastic Documents: Coupling Text and Tables through Contextual Visualizations for Enhanced Document Reading", "author": ["Badam,SriramKarthik", "Liu,Zhicheng", "Elmqvist,Niklas"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865119", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Today's data-rich documents are often complex datasets in themselves, consisting of information in different formats such as text, figures, and data tables. These additional media augment the textual narrative in the document. However, the static layout of a traditional for-print document often impedes deep understanding of its content because of the need to navigate to access content scattered throughout the text. In this paper, we seek to facilitate enhanced comprehension of such documents through a contextual visualization technique that couples text content with data tables contained in the document. We parse the text content and data tables, cross-link the components using a keyword-based matching algorithm, and generate on-demand visualizations based on the reader's current focus within a document. We evaluate this technique in a user study comparing our approach to a traditional reading experience. Results from our study show that (1) participants comprehend the content better with tighter coupling of text and data, (2) the contextual visualizations enable participants to develop better summaries that capture the main data-rich insights within the document, and (3) overall, our method enables participants to develop a more detailed understanding of the document content.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Badam,SriramKarthik", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}, {"source": "4", "target": "8"}, {"source": "4", "target": "9"}, {"source": "4", "target": "10"}, {"source": "5", "target": "11"}, {"source": "5", "target": "12"}, {"source": "5", "target": "13"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Badam,SriramKarthik", "1": "Mathisen,Andreas", "2": "Radle,Roman", "3": "Klokmose,ClemensN.", "4": "Elmqvist,Niklas", "5": "Liu,Zhicheng", "6": "Patnaik,Biswaksen", "7": "Batch,Andrea", "8": "Ondov,Brian", "9": "Jardine,Nicole", "10": "Franconeri,Steven", "11": "Law,Po-Ming", "12": "Malik,Sana", "13": "Basole,RahulC."}}
