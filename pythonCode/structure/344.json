However, simulation of granular media is still challenging due to the complexity of granular materials and the large number of discrete solid particles. As we know, dry granular materials could form a hybrid state between a fluid and a solid, therefore we propose a two-layer model and divide the simulation domain into a dilute layer, where granules can move freely as a fluid, and a dense layer, where granules act more like a solid. Motivated by the shallow water equations, we derive a set of shallow sand equations for modeling dry granular flows by depth-integrating three-dimensional governing equations along its vertical direction. Unlike previous methods for simulating a 2D granular media, our model does not restrict the depth of the granular media to be shallow anymore. To allow efficient fluid-solid interactions, we also present a ray casting algorithm for one-way solid-fluid coupling. Finally, we introduce a particle-tracking method to improve the visual representation. Our method can be efficiently implemented based on a height field and is fully compatible with modern GPUs, therefore allows us to simulate large-scale dry granular flows in real time.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "SGaze: A Data-Driven Eye-Head Coordination Model for Realtime Gaze Prediction", "author": ["Hu,Zhiming", "Zhang,Congyi", "Li,Sheng", "Wang,Guoping", "Manocha,Dinesh"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2019.2899187", "keywords": "", "abstract": "We present a novel, data-driven eye-head coordination model that can be used for realtime gaze prediction for immersive HMD-based applications without any external hardware or eye tracker. Our model (SGaze) is computed by generating a large dataset that corresponds to different users navigating in virtual worlds with different lighting conditions. We perform statistical analysis on the recorded data and observe a linear correlation between gaze positions and head rotation angular velocities. We also find that there exists a latency between eye movements and head movements. SGaze can work as a software-based realtime gaze predictor and we formulate a time related function between head movement and eye movement and use that for realtime gaze position prediction. We demonstrate the benefits of SGaze for gaze-contingent rendering and evaluate the results with a user study.", "cite": 5, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Li,Sheng", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}, {"id": "20"}, {"id": "21"}, {"id": "22"}, {"id": "23"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "7", "target": "8"}, {"source": "7", "target": "9"}, {"source": "7", "target": "10"}, {"source": "7", "target": "11"}, {"source": "7", "target": "12"}, {"source": "7", "target": "13"}, {"source": "7", "target": "14"}, {"source": "7", "target": "15"}, {"source": "7", "target": "16"}, {"source": "7", "target": "17"}, {"source": "7", "target": "18"}, {"source": "7", "target": "19"}, {"source": "7", "target": "20"}, {"source": "7", "target": "21"}, {"source": "7", "target": "22"}, {"source": "7", "target": "23"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Li,Sheng", "1": "Zhu,Kuixin", "2": "He,Xiaowei", "3": "Wang,Hongan", "4": "Wang,Guoping", "5": "Hu,Zhiming", "6": "Zhang,Congyi", "7": "Manocha,Dinesh", "8": "Randhavane,TanmayV", "9": "Bera,Aniket", "10": "Kubin,Emily", "11": "Gray,Kurt", "12": "Randhavane,Tanmay", "13": "Kapsaskis,Kyra", "14": "Ren,Jiaping", "15": "Xiang,Wei", "16": "Xiao,Yangxi", "17": "Yang,Ruigang", "18": "Jin,Xiaogang", "19": "Tian,Hao", "20": "Wang,Changbo", "21": "Zhang,Xinyu", "22": "Narang,Sahil", "23": "Best,Andrew"}}
