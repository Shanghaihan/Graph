Automatic beautification of roughly designed layouts can provide a more efficient solution but often lead to undesired results due to ambiguity problems. To facilitate ambiguity resolution in layout beautification, we present a novel user interface for visualizing and editing inferred relationships through an automatic global layout beautification process. First, our interface provides a preview of the beautified layout with inferred constraints without directly modifying an input layout. In this way, the user can easily keep refining beautification results by interactively repositioning and/or resizing elements in the input layout. Second, we present a gestural interface for editing automatically inferred constraints by directly interacting with the visualized constraints via simple gestures. Our technique is applicable to both 2D and 3D global layout beautification, supported by efficient system implementation that provides instant user feedback. Our user study validates that our tool is capable of creating, editing and refining layouts of graphic elements, and is significantly faster than the standard snap-dragging or command-based alignment tools for both 2D and 3D layout tasks.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Model-Guided 3D Sketching", "author": ["Xu,Pengfei", "Fu,Hongbo", "Zheng,Youyi", "Singh,Karan", "Huang,Hui", "Tai,Chiew-Lan"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2860016", "keywords": "", "abstract": "We present a novel 3D model-guided interface for in-situ sketching on 3D planes. Our work is motivated by evolutionary design, where existing 3D objects form the basis for conceptual re-design or further design exploration. We contribute a novel workflow that exploits the geometry of an underlying 3D model to infer 3D planes on which 2D strokes drawn that are on and around the 3D model should be meaningfully projected. This provides users with the nearly modeless fluidity of a sketching interface, and is particularly useful for 3D sketching over planes that are not easily accessible or do not preexist. We also provide an additional set of tools, including sketching with explicit plane selection and model-aware canvas manipulation.
