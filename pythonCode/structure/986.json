Our application domain is Clinical Biostatistics, where models are derived from patient data with the aim to obtain clinically meaningful insights and consequences. Development and interpretation of a proper model requires domain expertise and insight into model characteristics. Because of time constraints, often a limited number of candidate models is evaluated. Regression Explorer enables experts to quickly generate, evaluate, and compare many different models, taking the workflow for model development as starting point. Global patterns in parameter values of candidate models can be explored effectively. In addition, experts are enabled to compare candidate models across multiple subpopulations. The insights obtained can be used to formulate new hypotheses or to steer model development. The effectiveness of the tool is demonstrated for two uses cases: prediction of a cardiac conduction disorder in patients after receiving a heart valve implant and prediction of hypernatremia in critically ill patients.", "cite": 3, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Bouwman,ArthurR.A.", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Bouwman,ArthurR.A.", "1": "Dingen,Dennis", "2": "van'tVeer,Marcel", "3": "Houthuizen,Patrick", "4": "Mestrom,EvelineH.J.", "5": "Korsten,ErikH.H.M.", "6": "vanWijk,Jarke"}}
