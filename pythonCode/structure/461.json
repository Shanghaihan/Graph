Due to the problem's combinatorial nature, two main challenges arise. First, existing algorithms output large numbers of patterns many of which are uninteresting from a user's perspective. Second, as datasets grow, mining large numbers of patterns gets computationally expensive. There is, thus, a need for mining approaches that make it possible to focus the pattern search towards directions of interest. This work tackles this problem by combining interactive visualization with sequential pattern mining in order to create a \"transparent box\" execution model. We propose a novel approach to interactive visual sequence mining that allows the user to guide the execution of a pattern-growth algorithm at suitable points through a powerful visual interface. Our approach (1) introduces the possibility of using local constraints during the mining process, (2) allows stepwise visualization of patterns being mined, and (3) enables the user to steer the mining algorithm towards directions of interest. The use of local constraints significantly improves users' capability to progressively refine the search space without the need to restart computations. We exemplify our approach using two event sequence datasets; one composed of web page visits and another composed of individuals' activity sequences.", "cite": 2, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Identification of Temporally Varying Areas of Interest in Long-Duration Eye-Tracking Data Sets", "author": ["Muthumanickam,PrithivirajK.", "Vrotsou,Katerina", "Nordman,Aida", "Johansson,Jimmy", "Cooper,Matthew"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865042", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Eye-tracking has become an invaluable tool for the analysis of working practices in many technological fields of activity. Typically studies focus on short tasks and use static expected areas of interest (Aol) in the display to explore subjects' behaviour, making the analyst's task quite straightforward. In long-duration studies, where the observations may last several hours over a complete work session, the Aols may change over time in response to altering workload, emergencies or other variables making the analysis more difficult. This work puts forward a novel method to automatically identify spatial Aols changing over time through a combination of clustering and cluster merging in the temporal domain. A visual analysis system based on the proposed methods is also presented. Finally, we illustrate our approach within the domain of air traffic control, a complex task sensitive to prevailing conditions over long durations, though it is applicable to other domains such as monitoring of complex systems.", "cite": 3, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Nordman,Aida", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Nordman,Aida", "1": "Vrotsou,Katerina", "2": "Muthumanickam,PrithivirajK.", "3": "Johansson,Jimmy", "4": "Cooper,Matthew"}}
