By adopting a closed-loop alignment approach, in which not only the surface texture but also the projected image is tracked by a camera, the proposed method is free from a calibration or position adjustment between the camera and projector. We designed fiducial patterns to be inserted into a fast flapping sequence of binary frames of the DMD projector, which allows the simultaneous tracking of the surface texture and a fiducial geometry separate from a single image captured by the camera. The proposed method implemented on a CPU runs at 400 fps and enables arbitrary video contents to be \"stuck\" onto a variety of textured surfaces.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Kagami,Shingo", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Kagami,Shingo", "1": "Hashimoto,Koichi"}}
