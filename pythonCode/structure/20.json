Despite that the critiques of rainbow colormaps have been around and well-acknowledged for three decades, rainbow colormaps are still widely used today. One reason behind the resilience of rainbow colormaps is the lack of tools for users to create a continuous colormap that encodes semantics specific to the application concerned. In this paper, we present a web-based software system, CCC-Tool (short for Charting Continuous Colormaps) under the URL https://ccctool.com, for creating, editing, and analyzing such application-specific colormaps. We introduce the notion of \"colormap specification (CMS)\" that maintains the essential semantics required for defining a color mapping scheme. We provide users with a set of advanced utilities for constructing CMS's with various levels of complexity, examining their quality attributes using different plots, and exporting them to external application software. We present two case studies, demonstrating that the CCC-tool can help domain scientists as well as visualization experts in designing semantically-rich colormaps.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Why Visualize?

Thus, to contribute to the fundamental understanding of our discipline, we require a comprehensive collection of arguments on \"why visualize?\" (or \"why not?\"), untangling the rationale behind positive and negative viewpoints. In this paper, we report a theoretical study to understand the underlying reasons of various arguments; their relationships (e.g., built-on, and conflict); and their respective dependencies on tasks, users, and data. We curated an argumentative network based on a collection of arguments from various fields, including information visualization, cognitive science, psychology, statistics, philosophy, and others. Our work proposes several categorizations for the arguments, and makes their relations explicit. We contribute the first comprehensive and systematic theoretical study of the arguments on visualization. Thereby, we provide a roadmap towards building a foundation for visualization theory and empirical research as well as for practical application in the critique and design of visualizations.

In this paper, we examine this status quo from an information-theoretic perspective. Our objectives are to conduct cost-benefit analysis on typical VE systems (including augmented and mixed reality, theater-based systems, and large powerwalls). to explain why some visualization applications benefit more from VEs than others. and to sketch out pathways for the future development of visualization applications in VEs.

VA workflows have become increasingly important in understanding and improving Machine Learning (ML) processes. In this paper. we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely \"VA-assisted ML'. The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly.", "cite": 18, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Chen,Min", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}, {"id": "20"}, {"id": "21"}, {"id": "22"}, {"id": "23"}, {"id": "24"}, {"id": "25"}, {"id": "26"}, {"id": "27"}, {"id": "28"}, {"id": "29"}, {"id": "30"}, {"id": "31"}, {"id": "32"}, {"id": "33"}, {"id": "34"}, {"id": "35"}, {"id": "36"}, {"id": "37"}, {"id": "38"}, {"id": "39"}, {"id": "40"}, {"id": "41"}, {"id": "42"}, {"id": "43"}, {"id": "44"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "0", "target": "10"}, {"source": "0", "target": "11"}, {"source": "0", "target": "12"}, {"source": "0", "target": "13"}, {"source": "0", "target": "14"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "15"}, {"source": "2", "target": "16"}, {"source": "2", "target": "17"}, {"source": "2", "target": "18"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "15"}, {"source": "3", "target": "16"}, {"source": "3", "target": "17"}, {"source": "3", "target": "18"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "5", "target": "19"}, {"source": "5", "target": "20"}, {"source": "5", "target": "21"}, {"source": "5", "target": "22"}, {"source": "5", "target": "23"}, {"source": "5", "target": "24"}, {"source": "5", "target": "25"}, {"source": "6", "target": "26"}, {"source": "6", "target": "27"}, {"source": "6", "target": "28"}, {"source": "6", "target": "29"}, {"source": "6", "target": "30"}, {"source": "6", "target": "31"}, {"source": "6", "target": "32"}, {"source": "6", "target": "8"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "7", "target": "8"}, {"source": "7", "target": "33"}, {"source": "7", "target": "34"}, {"source": "7", "target": "35"}, {"source": "7", "target": "36"}, {"source": "7", "target": "37"}, {"source": "7", "target": "38"}, {"source": "7", "target": "14"}, {"source": "7", "target": "39"}, {"source": "7", "target": "40"}, {"source": "8", "target": "26"}, {"source": "8", "target": "27"}, {"source": "8", "target": "28"}, {"source": "8", "target": "29"}, {"source": "8", "target": "30"}, {"source": "8", "target": "31"}, {"source": "8", "target": "32"}, {"source": "8", "target": "39"}, {"source": "8", "target": "40"}, {"source": "8", "target": "35"}, {"source": "9", "target": "10"}, {"source": "9", "target": "11"}, {"source": "10", "target": "11"}, {"source": "12", "target": "13"}, {"source": "12", "target": "14"}, {"source": "13", "target": "14"}, {"source": "14", "target": "33"}, {"source": "14", "target": "34"}, {"source": "14", "target": "35"}, {"source": "14", "target": "36"}, {"source": "14", "target": "37"}, {"source": "14", "target": "38"}, {"source": "14", "target": "41"}, {"source": "14", "target": "42"}, {"source": "14", "target": "43"}, {"source": "14", "target": "44"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Chen,Min", "1": "Nardini,Pascal", "2": "Samsel,Francesca", "3": "Bujack,Roxana", "4": "Bottinger,Michael", "5": "Scheuermann,Gerik", "6": "Streeb,Dirk", "7": "El-Assady,Mennatallah", "8": "Keim,Daniel", "9": "Gaither,Kelly", "10": "John,NigelW.", "11": "McCann,Brian", "12": "Sacha,Dominik", "13": "Kraus,Matthias", "14": "Keim,DanielA.", "15": "Ware,Colin", "16": "Turton,TereceL.", "17": "Shrivastava,Piyush", "18": "Rogers,DavidH.", "19": "Raith,Felix", "20": "Blecha,Christian", "21": "Nagel,Thomas", "22": "Parisio,Francesco", "23": "Kolditz,Olaf", "24": "Guenther,Fabian", "25": "Stommel,Markus", "26": "Behrisch,Michael", "27": "Stoffel,Florian", "28": "Seebacher,Daniel", "29": "Matejek,Brian", "30": "Weber,StefanHagen", "31": "Mittelstaedt,Sebastian", "32": "Pfister,Hanspeter", "33": "Liu,Shixia", "34": "Wang,Xiting", "35": "Collins,Christopher", "36": "Dou,Wenwen", "37": "Ouyang,Fangxin", "38": "Jiang,Liu", "39": "Sperrle,Fabian", "40": "Deussen,Oliver", "41": "Buchmueller,Jun", "42": "Jaeckie,Dominik", "43": "Cakmak,Eren", "44": "Brandes,Ulrik"}}
