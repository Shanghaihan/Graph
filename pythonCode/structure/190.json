Redirected walking imperceptibly transforms the VE around the user with predefined estimated threshold gains. Previously estimated gains were evaluated with a 40 degrees field of view (FOV), and have not been evaluated in the presence of a distractor-a moving object in the VE that may capture the user's attention. We conducted a 2 (FOV: 40 degrees, 110 degrees) x 2 (Gender: female, male) x 2 (Distractor: without, with) user study to estimate and compare thresholds for rotation gains. Significant differences in detection thresholds were found between FOVs, and significant differences were found between female and male gains with a 110 degrees FOV. Males had significantly wider gains using a 110 degrees FOV compared to a 40 degrees FOV, and distractors affected females differently than males. Finally, strong correlations were found between simulator sickness scores and threshold gains.", "cite": 1, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Peck,TabithaC.", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Peck,TabithaC.", "1": "Williams,NiallL."}}
