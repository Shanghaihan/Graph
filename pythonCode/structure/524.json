To date, considerable effort has been devoted to their distinctive appearance and physically-based simulation. The apperance of staining patterns, commonly seen on textiles, has received comparatively little attention. This paper introduces techniques for simulating staining effects on fabric. Based on the microstructure of yarn, we propose a triple-layer model (TLM) to handle the liquid-yarn interaction for the wetting and wicking computation, and we formalize the liquid spreading in woven cloth into two typical actions, the in-yarn diffusion and the cross-yarn diffusion. The dye diffusion is driven by the liquid diffusion and the concentration distribution of pigments. The warp-weft anisotropy is handled by simulation of the yarn's structure in the two directions. Experimental results demonstrate that a wide range of fabric stain phenomenon on different textile materials, such as the water ring effect, the high saturate stain contour, and the dynamic wash away effect, can be simulated effectively without loss of visual realism. The realism of our simulation results is comparable to effects shown in photographs of real-world examples.", "cite": 1, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Wu,Enhua", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Wu,Enhua", "1": "Zheng,Yi", "2": "Chen,Yanyun", "3": "Fei,Guangzheng", "4": "Dorsey,Julie", "5": "Paczkowski,Patrick", "6": "Rushmeier,Holly", "7": "Kim,MinH."}}
