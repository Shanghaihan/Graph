Bias mitigation strategies often focus on the person, by educating people about their biases, typically with little success. We focus instead on the system, presenting the first evidence that altering the design of an interactive visualization tool can mitigate a strong bias the attraction effect. Participants viewed 2D scatterplots where choices between superior alternatives were affected by the placement of other suboptimal points. We found that highlighting the superior alternatives weakened the bias, but did not eliminate it. We then tested an interactive approach where participants completely removed locally dominated points from the view, inspired by the elimination by aspects strategy in the decision-making literature. This approach strongly decreased the bias, leading to a counterintuitive suggestion: tools that allow removing inappropriately salient or distracting data from a view may help lead users to make more rational decisions.", "cite": 8, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Face to Face: Evaluating Visual Comparison", "author": ["Ondov,Brian", "Jardine,Nicole", "Elmqvist,Niklas", "Franconeri,Steven"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864884", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Data are often viewed as a single set of values, but those values frequently must be compared with another set. The existing evaluations of designs that facilitate these comparisons tend to be based on intuitive reasoning, rather than quantifiable measures. We build on this work with a series of crowdsourced experiments that use low-level perceptual comparison tasks that arise frequently in comparisons within data visualizations (e.g., which value changes the most between the two sets of data?). Participants completed these tasks across a variety of layouts: overlaid, two arrangements of juxtaposed small multiples, mirror-symmetric small multiples, and animated transitions. A staircase procedure sought the difficulty level (e.g., value change delta) that led to equivalent accuracy for each layout. Confirming prior intuition, we observe high levels of performance for overlaid versus standard small multiples. However, we also find performance improvements for both mirror symmetric small multiples and animated transitions. While some results are incongruent with common wisdom in data visualization, they align with previous work in perceptual psychology, and thus have potentially strong implications for visual comparison designs.", "cite": 7, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Franconeri,Steven", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}, {"id": "20"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "8"}, {"source": "3", "target": "9"}, {"source": "3", "target": "10"}, {"source": "3", "target": "11"}, {"source": "3", "target": "12"}, {"source": "3", "target": "13"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "6", "target": "14"}, {"source": "6", "target": "15"}, {"source": "6", "target": "16"}, {"source": "6", "target": "17"}, {"source": "6", "target": "18"}, {"source": "6", "target": "19"}, {"source": "6", "target": "20"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Franconeri,Steven", "1": "Dimara,Evanthia", "2": "Bailly,Gilles", "3": "Bezerianos,Anastasia", "4": "Ondov,Brian", "5": "Jardine,Nicole", "6": "Elmqvist,Niklas", "7": "Gogolouis,Anna", "8": "Tsandilas,Theophanis", "9": "Palpanas,Themis", "10": "Blascheck,Tanja", "11": "Besancon,Lonni", "12": "Lee,Bongshin", "13": "Isenberg,Petra", "14": "Badam,SriramKarthik", "15": "Mathisen,Andreas", "16": "Radle,Roman", "17": "Klokmose,ClemensN.", "18": "Liu,Zhicheng", "19": "Patnaik,Biswaksen", "20": "Batch,Andrea"}}
