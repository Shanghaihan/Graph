The assessment works in a non-reference manner that directly measures the intrinsic smoothness of the video motion path. Specifically, the motion path is cast as a curve embedded in the Lie group of homographies, and its smoothness is mathematically characterized by the intrinsic geodesic curvature. A bundle of paths are adopted to handle spatially variant motions through the frames. Then, we compute the weighted curvature for a holistic assessment on the motion stability. Other factors related to video stabilization, e.g., distortion and cropping, are also investigated as supplement. We collect 160 shaky video clips and their stabilized results for verification, and the experimental evidence shows the effectiveness of our algorithm in good correlation with human subjective judgements.", "cite": 6, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Zheng,Qing-Zhuo", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Zheng,Qing-Zhuo", "1": "Zhang,Lei", "2": "Huang,Hua"}}
