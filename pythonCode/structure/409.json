We present a novel approach for generating a texture-mapped high-relief model from a single brush painting. Our aim is to extract the brushstrokes from a painting and generate the individual corresponding relief proxies rather than recovering the exact depth map from the painting, which is a tricky computer vision problem, requiring assumptions that are rarely satisfied. The relief proxies of brushstrokes are then combined together to form a 2.5D high-relief model. To extract brushstrokes from 2D paintings, we apply layer decomposition and stroke segmentation by imposing boundary constraints. The segmented brushstrokes preserve the style of the input painting. By inflation and a displacement map of each brushstroke, the features of brushstrokes are preserved by the resultant high-relief model of the painting. We demonstrate that our approach is able to produce convincing high-reliefs from a variety of paintings(with humans, animals, flowers, etc.). As a secondary application, we show how our brushstroke extraction algorithm could be used for image editing. As a result, our brushstroke extraction algorithm is specifically geared towards paintings with each brushstroke drawn very purposefully, such as Chinese paintings, Rosemailing paintings, etc.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Yeh,Chih-Kuo", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}, {"source": "4", "target": "8"}, {"source": "4", "target": "9"}, {"source": "4", "target": "10"}, {"source": "4", "target": "11"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Yeh,Chih-Kuo", "1": "Fu,Yunfei", "2": "Yu,Hongchuan", "3": "Zhang,Jianjun", "4": "Lee,Tong-Yee", "5": "Pan,Xingjia", "6": "Tang,Fan", "7": "Dong,Weiming", "8": "Ma,Chongyang", "9": "Meng,Yiping", "10": "Huang,Feiyue", "11": "Xu,Changsheng"}}
