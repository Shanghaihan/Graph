Our method integrates two components: candidate generation and candidate voting. Given a closed triangular mesh, we generate candidate distortion points by executing a three-step procedure repeatedly: (1) randomly cut an input to a disk topology; (2) compute a low conformal distortion parameterization; and (3) detect the distortion points. Finally, we count the candidate points and generate the final distortion points by voting. We demonstrate that our algorithm succeeds when employed on various closed meshes with a genus of zero or higher.

We propose a new patch normal co-filter (PcFilter) for mesh denoising. It is inspired by the geometry statistics which show that surface patches with similar intrinsic properties exist on the underlying surface of a noisy mesh. We model the PcFilter as a low-rank matrix recovery problem of similar-patch collaboration, aiming at removing different levels of noise, yet preserving various surface features. We generalize our model to pursue the low-rank matrix recovery in the kernel space for handling the nonlinear structure contained in the data. By making use of the block coordinate descent minimization and the specifics of a proximal based coordinate descent method, we optimize the nonlinear and nonconvex objective function efficiently.

The existing compatible remeshing methods usually suffer from high computational cost or poor quality. In this paper, we present a fast method for computing compatible meshes with high quality. Given two closed, oriented, and topologically equivalent surfaces and a sparse set of corresponding landmarks, we first compute a bijective inter-surface mapping, from which compatible meshes are generated. We then improve the remeshing quality by using a volume-enhanced optimization. In contrast to previous work, our method designs a fast volume-enhanced improvement procedure that directly reduces the isometric distortion of the map between the compatible meshes. Our method also tries to preserve the shapes of the input meshes by projecting the vertices of the compatible meshes onto the input surfaces. Central to this approach is the use of the monotone preconditioned conjugate gradient method, which minimizes the energies effectively and efficiently.

Based on the observation, we propose a three-phase algorithm for learning and predicting points of interest on 3D shapes by using multiple feature descriptors. Our algorithm requires two separate deep neural networks (stacked auto-encoders) to accomplish the task. During the first phase, we predict the membership of the given 3D shape according to a set of geometric descriptors using a deep neural network. After that, we train the other deep neural network to predict a probability distribution defined on the surface representing the possibility of a point being a point of interest.

This definition facilitates several succeeding operations, such as feature points extraction and point cloud filtering. We also develop a feature preserving normal estimation method which outputs multiple normals per feature point. The core of the method is a pair consistency voting scheme. All neighbor point pairs vote for the local tangent plane. Each vote takes the fitting residuals of the pair of points and their preliminary normal consistency into consideration. Thus the pairs from the same subspace and relatively far off features dominate the voting. An adaptive strategy is designed to overcome sampling anisotropy. In addition, we introduce an error measure compatible with traditional normal estimators, and present the first benchmark for normal estimation, composed of 152 synthesized data with various features and sampling densities, and 288 real scans with different noise levels.

Inspired by recent advances in image filtering, we propose a new geometry filtering technique called static/dynamic filter, which utilizes both static and dynamic guidances to achieve state-of-the-art results. The proposed filter is based on a nonlinear optimization that enforces smoothness of the signal while preserving variations that correspond to features of certain scales. We develop an efficient iterative solver for the problem, which unifies existing filters that are based on static or dynamic guidances. The filter can be applied to mesh face normals followed by vertex position update, to achieve scale-aware and feature-preserving filtering of mesh geometry.
