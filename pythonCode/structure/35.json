However, few reports have been made for moving generators despite their important applications. We present a topology-oriented event-increment (TOI-E) algorithm for constructing a Voronoi diagram of moving circular disks in the plane over the time horizon [ 0, t). The proposed TOI-E algorithm computes the event history of the Voronoi diagram over the entire time horizon in O(kF logn + kC n logn) time with O(n logn) preprocessing time and O(n + kF + kC) memory for n disk generators, kF edge flips, and kC disk collisions during the time horizon. Given an event history, the Voronoi diagram of an arbitrary moment can be constructed in O(k* + n) time where k* represents the number of events in [0, t*). An example of the collision avoidance problem among moving disks is given by predicting future conjunctions among the disks using the proposed algorithm. Dynamic Voronoi diagrams will be very useful as a platform for the planning and management of the traffics of unmanned vehicles such as cars on street, vessels on surface, drones and airplanes in air, and satellites in geospace.", "cite": 1, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Lee,Mokwon", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Lee,Mokwon", "1": "Song,Chanyoung", "2": "Cha,Jehyun", "3": "Kim,Deok-Soo"}}
