Coordinated relationships can be formalized as biclusters. In order to support visual exploration of biclusters, bipartite graphs based visualizations have been proposed, and edge bundling is used to show biclusters. However, it suffers from edge crossings due to possible overlaps of biclusters, and lacks in-depth understanding of its impact on user exploring biclusters in bipartite graphs. To address these, we propose a novel bicluster-based seriation technique that can reduce edge crossings in bipartite graphs drawing and conducted a user experiment to study the effect of edge bundling and this proposed technique on visualizing biclusters in bipartite graphs. We found that they both had impact on reducing entity visits for users exploring biclusters, and edge bundles helped them find more justified answers. Moreover, we identified four key trade-offs that inform the design of future bicluster visualizations. The study results suggest that edge bundling is critical for exploring biclusters in bipartite graphs, which helps to reduce low-level perceptual problems and support high-level inferences.", "cite": 1, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Smooth, Efficient, and Interruptible Zooming and Panning", "author": ["Reach,AndrewMcCaleb", "North,Chris"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2800013", "keywords": "", "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel technique for smooth and efficient zooming and panning based on dynamical systems in hyperbolic space.

From the analyst's perceptual and cognitive perspective, current visualization approaches typically treat the observations of the high-dimensional dataset very differently from the attributes. Often, the attributes are treated as inputs (e.g., sliders), and observations as outputs (e.g., projection plots), thus emphasizing investigation of the observations. However, there are many cases in which analysts wish to investigate both the observations and the attributes of the dataset, suggesting a symmetry between how analysts think about attributes and observations. To address this, we define SIRIUS (Symmetric Interactive Representations In a Unified System), a symmetric, dual projection technique to support exploratory data analysis of high-dimensional data. We provide an example implementation of SIRIUS and demonstrate how this symmetry affords additional insights.", "cite": 5, "year": "2019"}], "name": "North,Chris", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "0", "target": "10"}, {"source": "0", "target": "11"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "12"}, {"source": "1", "target": "13"}, {"source": "1", "target": "14"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "15"}, {"source": "2", "target": "16"}, {"source": "2", "target": "17"}, {"source": "2", "target": "18"}, {"source": "2", "target": "19"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "7", "target": "8"}, {"source": "7", "target": "9"}, {"source": "7", "target": "10"}, {"source": "7", "target": "11"}, {"source": "8", "target": "9"}, {"source": "8", "target": "10"}, {"source": "8", "target": "11"}, {"source": "9", "target": "10"}, {"source": "9", "target": "11"}, {"source": "10", "target": "11"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "North,Chris", "1": "Sun,Maoyuan", "2": "Zhao,Jian", "3": "Wu,Hao", "4": "Luther,Kurt", "5": "Ramakrishnan,Naren", "6": "Reach,AndrewMcCaleb", "7": "Dowling,Michelle", "8": "Wenskovitch,John", "9": "Fry,J.T.", "10": "Leman,Scotland", "11": "House,Leanna", "12": "Camisetty,Akhilesh", "13": "Chandurkar,Chaitanya", "14": "Koop,David", "15": "Lu,Zhicong", "16": "Fan,Mingming", "17": "Wang,Yun", "18": "Annett,Michelle", "19": "Wigdor,Daniel"}}
