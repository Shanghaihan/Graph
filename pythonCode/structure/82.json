CMed can be used to visualize, classify, and filter crowdsourced clinical data based on a number of different metrics such as detection rate, logged events, and clustering of the annotations. CMed provides several interactive linked visualization components to analyze the crowd annotation results for a particular video and the associated workers. Additionally, all results of an individual worker can be inspected using multiple linked views in our CMed framework. We allow a crowdsourcing application analyst to observe patterns and gather insights into the crowdsourced medical data, helping him/her design future crowdsourcing applications for optimal output from the workers. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework with two medical crowdsourcing studies: polyp detection in virtual colonoscopy videos and lung nodule detection in CT thin-slab maximum intensity projection videos. We also provide experts' feedback to show the effectiveness of our framework. Lastly, we share the lessons we learned from our framework with suggestions for integrating our framework into a clinical workflow.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "FeatureLego: Volume Exploration Using Exhaustive Clustering of Super-Voxels", "author": ["Jadhav,Shreeraj", "Nadeem,Saad", "Kaufman,Arie"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2856744", "keywords": "", "abstract": "We present a volume exploration framework, FeatureLego, that uses a novel voxel clustering approach for efficient selection of semantic features. We partition the input volume into a set of compact super-voxels that represent the finest selection granularity. We then performan exhaustive clustering of these super-voxels using a graph-based clustering method. Unlike the prevalent brute-force parameter sampling approaches, we propose an efficient algorithm to performthis exhaustive clustering. By computing an exhaustive set of clusters, we aim to capture as many boundaries as possible and ensure that the user has sufficient options for efficiently selecting semantically relevant features. Furthermore, we merge all the computed clusters into a single tree of meta-clusters that can be used for hierarchical exploration. We implement an intuitive user-interface to interactively explore volumes using our clustering approach.
