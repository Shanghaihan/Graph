Recent research into the automation of this task has yielded methods that can synthesize layouts of objects respecting aesthetic and functional constraints that are non-linear and competing. These methods usually adopt a stochastic optimization scheme, which samples from different layout configurations, a process that is slow and inefficient. We introduce an physics-motivated, continuous layout synthesis technique, which results in a significant gain in speed and is readily scalable. We demonstrate our method on a variety of examples and show that it achieves results similar to conventional layout synthesis based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) state-search, but is faster by at least an order of magnitude and can handle layouts of unprecedented size as well as tightly-packed layouts that can overwhelm McMC.", "cite": 2, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Nakada,Masaki", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "7"}, {"source": "5", "target": "8"}, {"source": "5", "target": "9"}, {"source": "5", "target": "10"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Nakada,Masaki", "1": "Weiss,Tomer", "2": "Litteneker,Alan", "3": "Duncan,Noah", "4": "Jiang,Chenfanfu", "5": "Yu,Lap-Fai", "6": "Terzopoulos,Demetri", "7": "Liang,Wei", "8": "Liu,Jingjing", "9": "Lang,Yining", "10": "Ning,Bing"}}
