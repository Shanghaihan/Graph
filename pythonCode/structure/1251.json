A common strategy to deal with large-scale scientific simulation data is to partition the simulation domain and create statistical data summaries. Instead of storing the high-resolution raw data from the simulation, storing the compact statistical data summaries results in reduced storage overhead and alleviated I/O bottleneck. Such summaries, often represented in the form of statistical probability distributions, can serve various post-hoc analysis and visualization tasks. However, for multivariate simulation data using standard multivariate distributions for creating data summaries is not feasible. They are either storage inefficient or are computationally expensive to be estimated in simulation time (in situ) for large number of variables. In this work, using copula functions, we propose a flexible multivariate distribution-based data modeling and analysis framework that offers significant data reduction and can be used in an in situ environment. The framework also facilitates in storing the associated spatial information along with the multivariate distributions in an efficient representation. Using the proposed multivariate data summaries, we perform various multivariate post-hoc analyses like query-driven visualization and sampling-based visualization. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple real-world multivariate scientific datasets. To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in an in situ environment, we apply it on a large-scale flow simulation.", "cite": 3, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Dutta,Soumya", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "7"}, {"source": "2", "target": "8"}, {"source": "2", "target": "9"}, {"source": "2", "target": "10"}, {"source": "2", "target": "11"}, {"source": "2", "target": "12"}, {"source": "2", "target": "13"}, {"source": "2", "target": "14"}, {"source": "2", "target": "15"}, {"source": "2", "target": "16"}, {"source": "2", "target": "17"}, {"source": "2", "target": "18"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Dutta,Soumya", "1": "Hazarika,Subhashis", "2": "Shen,Han-Wei", "3": "Chen,Jen-Ping", "4": "Wang,Junpeng", "5": "Li,Cheng", "6": "Guo,Hanqi", "7": "He,Wenbin", "8": "Seo,Sangmin", "9": "Constantinescu,EmilMihai", "10": "Liu,Chunhui", "11": "Peterka,Tom", "12": "Gou,Liang", "13": "Zhang,Wei", "14": "Yang,Hao", "15": "Ji,Xiaonan", "16": "Ritter,Alan", "17": "Machiraju,Raghu", "18": "Yen,Po-Yin"}}
