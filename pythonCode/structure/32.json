In Experiment 1, participants played a tabletop game with a VH, in which each player takes a turn and moves their own token along the designated spots on the shared table. We compared two conditions as follows: in \"virtual\" condition the VH moves a virtual token that is only visible through AR glasses, while the VH in \"physical\" condition moves a physical token; therefore the VH's token is visible even in the periphery of the AR glasses. Our results indicate that participants felt higher co-presence with the VH and assessed the VH as a more physical entity in the \"physical\" condition compared to the \"virtual\" condition. Also, VH's physical influence improved the overall gameplay experience. In Experiment 2, we further looked into how the physical-virtual latency affected the perceived plausibility of the VH's interaction with the real world. Our results indicate that a slight delay between the physical token reacting to the virtual hand's movement increased the perceived realism and causality of the mixed reality interaction. We discuss potential explanations for the findings and implications for future shared mixed reality tabletop setups.", "cite": 1, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Implementation and Evaluation of a 50 kHz, 28 mu s Motion-to-Pose Latency Head Tracking Instrument", "author": ["Blate,Alex", "Whitton,Mary", "Singh,Montek", "Welch,Greg", "State,Andrei", "Whitted,Turner", "Fuchs,Henry"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2019.2899233", "keywords": "", "abstract": "This paper presents the implementation and evaluation of a 50,000-pose-sample-per-second, 6-degree-of-freedom optical head tracking instrument with motion-to-pose latency of 28 mu s and dynamic precision of 1-2 arcminutes. The instrument uses high-intensity infrared emitters and two duo-lateral photodiode-based optical sensors to triangulate pose. This instrument serves two purposes: it is the first step towards the requisite head tracking component in sub-100 mu s motion-to-photon latency optical see-through augmented reality (OST AR) head-mounted display (HMD) systems; and it enables new avenues of research into human visual perception - including measuring the thresholds for perceptible real-virtual displacement during head rotation and other human research requiring high-sample-rate motion tracking. The instrument's tracking volume is limited to about 120x120x250mm but allows for the full range of natural head rotation and is sufficient for research involving seated users. We discuss how the instrument's tracking volume is scalable in multiple ways and some of the trade-offs involved therein. Finally, we introduce a novel laser-pointer-based measurement technique for assessing the instrument's tracking latency and repeatability. We show that the instrument's motion-to-pose latency is 28 mu s and that it is repeatable within 1-2 arcminutes at mean rotational velocities (yaw) in excess of 500 degrees/sec.", "cite": 1, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Welch,Greg", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}, {"id": "20"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "0", "target": "10"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "7"}, {"source": "5", "target": "8"}, {"source": "5", "target": "9"}, {"source": "5", "target": "10"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "8"}, {"source": "6", "target": "9"}, {"source": "6", "target": "10"}, {"source": "7", "target": "8"}, {"source": "7", "target": "9"}, {"source": "7", "target": "10"}, {"source": "8", "target": "11"}, {"source": "8", "target": "12"}, {"source": "8", "target": "13"}, {"source": "8", "target": "14"}, {"source": "8", "target": "15"}, {"source": "8", "target": "10"}, {"source": "8", "target": "9"}, {"source": "9", "target": "10"}, {"source": "10", "target": "11"}, {"source": "10", "target": "12"}, {"source": "10", "target": "13"}, {"source": "10", "target": "14"}, {"source": "10", "target": "15"}, {"source": "10", "target": "16"}, {"source": "10", "target": "17"}, {"source": "10", "target": "18"}, {"source": "10", "target": "19"}, {"source": "10", "target": "20"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Welch,Greg", "1": "Lee,Myungho", "2": "Norouzi,Nahal", "3": "Bruder,Gerd", "4": "Wisniewski,Pamela", "5": "Blate,Alex", "6": "Whitton,Mary", "7": "Singh,Montek", "8": "State,Andrei", "9": "Whitted,Turner", "10": "Fuchs,Henry", "11": "Xia,Xinxing", "12": "Guan,Yunqing", "13": "Chakravarthula,Praneeth", "14": "Rathinavel,Kishore", "15": "Cham,Tat-Jen", "16": "Wetzstein,Gordon", "17": "Aksit,Kaan", "18": "Jeong,Youngmo", "19": "Albert,Rachel", "20": "Luebke,David"}}
