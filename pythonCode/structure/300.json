Our work is motivated by evolutionary design, where existing 3D objects form the basis for conceptual re-design or further design exploration. We contribute a novel workflow that exploits the geometry of an underlying 3D model to infer 3D planes on which 2D strokes drawn that are on and around the 3D model should be meaningfully projected. This provides users with the nearly modeless fluidity of a sketching interface, and is particularly useful for 3D sketching over planes that are not easily accessible or do not preexist. We also provide an additional set of tools, including sketching with explicit plane selection and model-aware canvas manipulation. Our system is evaluated with a user study, showing that our technique is easy to learn and effective for rapid sketching of product design variations around existing 3D models.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "3D Tooth Segmentation and Labeling Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks", "author": ["Xu,Xiaojie", "Liu,Chang", "Zheng,Youyi"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2839685", "keywords": "", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach for 3D dental model segmentation via deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Traditional geometry-based methods tend to receive undesirable results due to the complex appearance of human teeth (e.g., missing/rotten teeth, feature-less regions, crowding teeth, extra medical attachments, etc.). Furthermore, labeling of individual tooth is hardly enabled in traditional tooth segmentation methods. To address these issues, we propose to learn a generic and robust segmentation model by exploiting deep Neural Networks, namely NNs. The segmentation task is achieved by labeling each mesh face. We extract a set of geometry features as face feature representations. In the training step, the network is fed with those features, and produces a probability vector, of which each element indicates the probability a face belonging to the corresponding model part. To this end, we extensively experiment with various network structures, and eventually arrive at a 2-level hierarchical CNNs structure for tooth segmentation: one for teeth-gingiva labeling and the other for inter-teeth labeling. Further, we propose a novel boundary-aware tooth simplification method to significantly improve efficiency in the stage of feature extraction. After CNNs prediction, we do graph-based label optimization and further refine the boundary with an improved version of fuzzy clustering. The accuracy of our mesh labeling method exceeds that of the state-of-art geometry-based methods, reaching 99.06 percent measured by area which is directly applicable in orthodontic CAD systems. It is also robust to any possible foreign matters on model surface, e.g., air bubbles, dental accessories, and many more.", "cite": 17, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Zheng,Youyi", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "1", "target": "8"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "9"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "8"}, {"source": "2", "target": "9"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "10"}, {"source": "2", "target": "11"}, {"source": "2", "target": "12"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "8"}, {"source": "4", "target": "9"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "13"}, {"source": "4", "target": "14"}, {"source": "4", "target": "15"}, {"source": "4", "target": "16"}, {"source": "4", "target": "17"}, {"source": "4", "target": "18"}, {"source": "5", "target": "8"}, {"source": "5", "target": "9"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Zheng,Youyi", "1": "Xu,Pengfei", "2": "Fu,Hongbo", "3": "Singh,Karan", "4": "Huang,Hui", "5": "Tai,Chiew-Lan", "6": "Xu,Xiaojie", "7": "Liu,Chang", "8": "Yan,Guohang", "9": "Igarashi,Takeo", "10": "Yuan,Ming-Ze", "11": "Gao,Lin", "12": "Xia,Shihong", "13": "Yin,Kangxue", "14": "Ho,EdmondS.L.", "15": "Wang,Hao", "16": "Komura,Taku", "17": "Cohen-Or,Daniel", "18": "Zhang,Hao"}}
