However, little is known about how basic tabular data visualizations perform across varying data analysis tasks. In this paper, we report results from a crowdsourced experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of five small scale (5-34 data points) two-dimensional visualization types-Table, Line Chart, Bar Chart, Scatterplot, and Pie Chart-across ten common data analysis tasks using two datasets. We find the effectiveness of these visualization types significantly varies across task, suggesting that visualization design would benefit from considering context-dependent effectiveness. Based on our findings, we derive recommendations on which visualizations to choose based on different tasks. We finally train a decision tree on the data we collected to drive a recommender, showcasing how to effectively engineer experimental user data into practical visualization systems.", "cite": 7, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Embedded Merge & Split: Visual Adjustment of Data Grouping", "author": ["Sarvghad,Ali", "Saket,Bahador", "Endert,Alex", "Weibel,Nadir"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865075", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Data grouping is among the most frequently used operations in data visualization. It is the process through which relevant information is gathered, simplified, and expressed in summary form. Many popular visualization tools support automatic grouping of data (e.g., dividing up a numerical variable into bins). Although grouping plays a pivotal role in supporting data exploration, further adjustment and customization of auto-generated grouping criteria is non-trivial. Such adjustments are currently performed either programmatically or through menus and dialogues which require specific parameter adjustments over several steps. In response, we introduce Embedded Merge & Split (EMS), a new interaction technique for direct adjustment of data grouping criteria. We demonstrate how the EMS technique can be designed to directly manipulate width and position in bar charts and histograms, as a means for adjustment of data grouping criteria. We also offer a set of design guidelines for supporting EMS. Finally, we present the results of two user studies, providing initial evidence that EMS can significantly reduce interaction time compared to WIMP-based technique and was subjectively preferred by participants.", "cite": 2, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Saket,Bahador", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "7"}, {"source": "1", "target": "8"}, {"source": "1", "target": "9"}, {"source": "1", "target": "10"}, {"source": "1", "target": "11"}, {"source": "1", "target": "12"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "13"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Saket,Bahador", "1": "Endert,Alex", "2": "Demiralp,Cagatay", "3": "Sarvghad,Ali", "4": "Weibel,Nadir", "5": "Wall,Emily", "6": "Agnihotri,Meeshu", "7": "Matzen,Laura", "8": "Divis,Kristin", "9": "Haass,Michael", "10": "Stasko,John", "11": "Srinivasan,Arjun", "12": "Drucker,StevenM.", "13": "Cavallo,Marco"}}
