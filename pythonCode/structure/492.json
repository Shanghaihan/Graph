However, most prior studies focus on using low-level visual features of images, such as texture and color histogram, to create visualizations without considering the more important semantic information embedded in images. This paper proposes a novel visual analytic system to analyze images in a semantic-aware manner. The system mainly comprises two components: a semantic information extractor and a visual layout generator. The semantic information extractor employs an image captioning technique based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to produce descriptive captions for images, which can be transformed into semantic keywords. The layout generator employs a novel co-embedding model to project images and the associated semantic keywords to the same 2D space. Inspired by the galaxy metaphor, we further turn the projected 2D space to a galaxy visualization of images, in which semantic keywords and images are visually encoded as stars and planets. Our system naturally supports multi-scale visualization and navigation, in which users can immediately see a semantic overview of an image collection and drill down for detailed inspection of a certain group of images. Users can iteratively refine the visual layout by integrating their domain knowledge into the co-embedding process. Two task-based evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.", "cite": 5, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "ForVizor: Visualizing Spatio-Temporal Team Formations in Soccer", "author": ["Wu,Yingcai", "Xie,Xiao", "Wang,Jiachen", "Deng,Dazhen", "Liang,Hongye", "Zhang,Hui", "Cheng,Shoubin", "Chen,Wei"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865041", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Regarded as a high-level tactic in soccer, a team formation assigns players different tasks and indicates their active regions on the pitch, thereby influencing the team performance significantly. Analysis of formations in soccer has become particularly indispensable for soccer analysts. However, formations of a team are intrinsically time-varying and contain inherent spatial information. The spatio-temporal nature of formations and other characteristics of soccer data, such as multivariate features, make analysis of formations in soccer a challenging problem. In this study, we closely worked with domain experts to characterize domain problems of formation analysis in soccer and formulated several design goals. We design a novel spatio-temporal visual representation of changes in team formation, allowing analysts to visually analyze the evolution of formations and track the spatial flow of players within formations over time. Based on the new design, we further design and develop ForVizor, a visual analytics system, which empowers users to track the spatio-temporal changes in formation and understand how and why such changes occur. With For Vizor, domain experts conduct formation analysis of two games.

However, the existing techniques cannot satisfactorily support the analysis tasks involved in ranking large-scale spatial alternatives, such as selecting optimal locations for chain stores, where the complex spatial contexts involved are essential to the decision-making process. Limitations observed in the prior attempts of integrating rankings with spatial contexts motivate us to develop a context-integrated visual ranking technique. Based on a set of generic design requirements we summarized by collaborating with domain experts, we propose SRVis, a novel spatial ranking visualization technique that supports efficient spatial multi-criteria decision-making processes by addressing three major challenges in the aforementioned context integration, namely, a) the presentation of spatial rankings and contexts, b) the scalability of rankings' visual representations, and c) the analysis of context-integrated spatial rankings. Specifically, we encode massive rankings and their cause with scalable matrix-based visualizations and stacked bar charts based on a novel two-phase optimization framework that minimizes the information loss, and the flexible spatial filtering and intuitive comparative analysis are adopted to enable the in-depth evaluation of the rankings and assist users in selecting the best spatial alternative. The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been evaluated and demonstrated with an empirical study of optimization methods, two case studies, and expert interviews.", "cite": 5, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "iStoryline: Effective Convergence to Hand-drawn Storylines", "author": ["Tang,Tan", "Rubab,Sadia", "Lai,Jiewen", "Cui,Weiwei", "Yu,Lingyun", "Wu,Yingcai"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864899", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Storyline visualization techniques have progressed significantly to generate illustrations of complex stories automatically.

Existing methods attempt to achieve several shared optimization goals, such as reducing empty space and minimizing line crossings and wiggles. However, these goals do not always produce optimal results when compared to hand-drawn storylines. We conducted a preliminary study to learn how users translate a narrative into a hand-drawn storyline and check whether the visual elements in hand-drawn illustrations can be mapped back to appropriate narrative contexts. We also compared the hand-drawn storylines with storylines generated by the state-of-the-art methods and found they have significant differences. Our findings led to a design space that summarizes 1) how artists utilize narrative elements and 2) the sequence of actions artists follow to portray expressive and attractive storylines. We developed iStoryline, an authoring tool for integrating high-level user interactions into optimization algorithms and achieving a balance between hand-drawn storylines and automatic layouts. iStoryline allows users to create novel storyline visualizations easily according to their preferences by modifying the automatically generated layouts.
