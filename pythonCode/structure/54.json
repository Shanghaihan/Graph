Our system addresses the challenging task of predicting their physical behavior by fully integrating the multibody dynamics of the mechanical skeleton and the elastic behavior of the soft skin. The developed motion control strategy uses an alternating optimization scheme to avoid expensive full space time-optimization, interleaving space-time optimization for the skeleton and frame-by-frame optimization for the full dynamics. The output are motor torques to drive the robot to achieve a user prescribed motion trajectory. We also provide a collection of convenient engineering tools and empirical manufacturing guidance to support the fabrication of the designed quad-robot. We validate the feasibility of designs generated with our system through physics simulations and with a physically-fabricated prototype.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Multi-Scale Hybrid Micro-Appearance Modeling and Realtime Rendering of Thin Fabrics.", "author": ["Xu,Chao", "Wang,Rui", "Zhao,Shuang", "Bao,Hujun"], "soname": "IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2019.2949406", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Micro-appearance models offer state-of-the-art quality for cloth renderings. Unfortunately, they usually rely on 3D volumes or fiber meshes that are not only data-intensive but also expensive to render. Traditional surface-based models, on the other hand, are light-weight and fast to render but normally lack the fidelity and details important for design and prototyping applications. We introduce a multi-scale, hybrid model to bridge this gap for thin fabrics. Our model enjoys both the compactness and speedy rendering offered by traditional surface-based models and the rich details provided by the micro-appearance models. Further, we propose a new algorithm to convert state-of-the-art micro-appearance models into our representation while qualitatively preserving the detailed appearance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by integrating it into a real-time rendering system.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Bao,Hujun", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "7", "target": "8"}, {"source": "7", "target": "9"}, {"source": "8", "target": "9"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Bao,Hujun", "1": "Feng,Xudong", "2": "Liu,Jiafeng", "3": "Yang,Yin", "4": "Wang,Huamin", "5": "Bickel,Bernd", "6": "Xu,Weiwei", "7": "Xu,Chao", "8": "Wang,Rui", "9": "Zhao,Shuang"}}
