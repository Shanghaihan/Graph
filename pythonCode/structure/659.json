We present an immersive analytics system for VC which enhances and improves the traditional desktop VC through the use of VR technologies. Our system, using a head-mounted display (HMD), includes all of the standard VC features, such as the volume rendered endoluminal fly-through, measurement tool, bookmark modes, electronic biopsy, and slice views. The use of VR immersion, stereo, and wider field of view and field of regard has a positive effect on polyp search and analysis tasks in our immersive VC system, a volumetric-based immersive analytics application. Navigation includes enhanced automatic speed and direction controls, based on the user's head orientation, in conjunction with physical navigation for exploration of local proximity. In order to accommodate the resolution and frame rate requirements for HMDs, new rendering techniques have been developed, including mesh-assisted volume raycasting and a novel lighting paradigm. Feedback and further suggestions from expert radiologists show the promise of our system for immersive analysis for VC and encourage new avenues for exploring the use of VR in visualization systems for medical diagnosis.", "cite": 1, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Gutenko,Ievgeniia", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "8"}, {"source": "3", "target": "9"}, {"source": "3", "target": "10"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "4", "target": "11"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}, {"source": "4", "target": "12"}, {"source": "4", "target": "13"}, {"source": "4", "target": "14"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Gutenko,Ievgeniia", "1": "Mirhosseini,Seyedkoosha", "2": "Ojal,Sushant", "3": "Marino,Joseph", "4": "Kaufman,Arie", "5": "Park,JiHwan", "6": "Nadeem,Saad", "7": "Boorboor,Saeed", "8": "Kaufman,ArieE", "9": "Dmitriev,Konstantin", "10": "Baker,Kevin", "11": "Jadhav,Shreeraj", "12": "Ananth,Mala", "13": "Talmage,David", "14": "Role,Lorna"}}
