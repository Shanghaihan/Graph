In Experiment 1, participants played a tabletop game with a VH, in which each player takes a turn and moves their own token along the designated spots on the shared table. We compared two conditions as follows: in \"virtual\" condition the VH moves a virtual token that is only visible through AR glasses, while the VH in \"physical\" condition moves a physical token; therefore the VH's token is visible even in the periphery of the AR glasses. Our results indicate that participants felt higher co-presence with the VH and assessed the VH as a more physical entity in the \"physical\" condition compared to the \"virtual\" condition. Also, VH's physical influence improved the overall gameplay experience. In Experiment 2, we further looked into how the physical-virtual latency affected the perceived plausibility of the VH's interaction with the real world. Our results indicate that a slight delay between the physical token reacting to the virtual hand's movement increased the perceived realism and causality of the mixed reality interaction. We discuss potential explanations for the findings and implications for future shared mixed reality tabletop setups.", "cite": 1, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Bruder,Gerd", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}, {"source": "4", "target": "8"}, {"source": "4", "target": "9"}, {"source": "4", "target": "10"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Bruder,Gerd", "1": "Lee,Myungho", "2": "Norouzi,Nahal", "3": "Wisniewski,Pamela", "4": "Welch,Greg", "5": "Blate,Alex", "6": "Whitton,Mary", "7": "Singh,Montek", "8": "State,Andrei", "9": "Whitted,Turner", "10": "Fuchs,Henry"}}
