Analysts often interweave querying and mining in a recursive manner during event sequence analysis: sequences extracted as query results are used for mining patterns, patterns generated are incorporated into a new query for segmenting the sequences, and the resulting segments are mined or queried again. To support flexible analysis, we propose a framework that describes the process of interwoven querying and mining. Based on this framework, we developed MAQUI, a Mining And Querying User Interface that enables recursive event sequence exploration. To understand the efficacy of MAQUI, we conducted two case studies with domain experts. The findings suggest that the capability of interweaving querying and mining helps the participants articulate their questions and gain novel insights from their data.", "cite": 6, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Duet: Helping Data Analysis Novices Conduct Pairwise Comparisons by Minimal Specification", "author": ["Law,Po-Ming", "Basole,RahulC.", "Wu,Yanhong"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864526", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Data analysis novices often encounter barriers in executing low-level operations for pairwise comparisons. They may also run into barriers in interpreting the artifacts (e.g., visualizations) created as a result of the operations. We developed Duet, a visual analysis system designed to help data analysis novices conduct pairwise comparisons by addressing execution and interpretation barriers. To reduce the barriers in executing low-level operations during pairwise comparison, Duet employs minimal specification: when one object group (i.e. a group of records in a data table) is specified, Duet recommends object groups that are similar to or different from the specified one; when two object groups are specified, Duet recommends similar and different attributes between them. To lower the barriers in interpreting its recommendations, Duet explains the recommended groups and attributes using both visualizations and textual descriptions. We conducted a qualitative evaluation with eight participants to understand the effectiveness of Duet. The results suggest that minimal specification is easy to use and Duet's explanations are helpful for interpreting the recommendations despite some usability issues.", "cite": 5, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Graphicle: Exploring Units, Networks, and Context in a Blended Visualization Approach", "author": ["Major,Timothy", "Basole,RahulC."], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865151", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Many real-world datasets are large, multivariate, and relational in nature and relevant associated decisions frequently require a simultaneous consideration of both attributes and connections. Existing visualization systems and approaches, however, often make an explicit trade-off between either affording rich exploration of individual data units and their attributes or exploration of the underlying network structure. In doing so, important analysis opportunities and insights are potentially missed. In this study, we aim to address this gap by (1) considering visualizations and interaction techniques that blend the spectrum between unit and network visualizations, (2) discussing the nature of different forms of contexts and the challenges in implementing them, and (3) demonstrating the value of our approach for visual exploration of multivariate, relational data for a real-world use case. Specifically, we demonstrate through a system called Graphicle how network structure can be layered on top of unit visualization techniques to create new opportunities for visual exploration of physician characteristics and referral data.
