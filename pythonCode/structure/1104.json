In this paper. we look at the broad scope of how dashboards are used in practice through an analysis of dashboard examples and documentation about their use. We systematically review the literature surrounding dashboard use, construct a design space for dashboards, and identify major dashboard types. We characterize dashboards by their design goals, levels of interaction, and the practices around them. Our framework and literature review suggest a number of fruitful research directions to better support dashboard design, implementation, and use.", "cite": 15, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Looks Good To Me: Visualizations As Sanity Checks", "author": ["Correll,Michael", "Li,Mingwei", "Kindlmann,Gordon", "Scheidegger,Carlos"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864907", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Famous examples such as Anscombe's Quartet highlight that one of the core benefits of visualizations is allowing people to discover visual patterns that might otherwise be hidden by summary statistics. This visual inspection is particularly important in exploratory data analysis, where analysts can use visualizations such as histograms and dot plots to identify data quality issues. Yet, these visualizations are driven by parameters such as histogram bin size or mark opacity that have a great deal of impact on the final visual appearance of the chart, but are rarely optimized to make important features visible. In this paper, we show that data flaws have varying impact on the visual features of visualizations, and that the adversarial or merely uncritical setting of design parameters of visualizations can obscure the visual signatures of these flaws. Drawing on the framework of Algebraic Visualization Design, we present the results of a crowdsourced study showing that common visualization types can appear to reasonably summarize distributional data while hiding large and important flaws such as missing data and extraneous modes. We make use of these results to propose additional best practices for visualizations of distributions for data quality tasks.", "cite": 6, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "In Pursuit of Error: A Survey of Uncertainty Visualization Evaluation", "author": ["Hullman,Jessica", "Qiao,Xiaoli", "Correll,Michael", "Kale,Alex", "Kay,Matthew"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864889", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Understanding and accounting for uncertainty is critical to effectively reasoning about visualized data. However, evaluating the impact of an uncertainty visualization is complex due to the difficulties that people have interpreting uncertainty and the challenge of defining correct behavior with uncertainty information. Currently, evaluators of uncertainty visualization must rely on general purpose visualization evaluation frameworks which can be ill-equipped to provide guidance with the unique difficulties of assessing judgments under uncertainty. To help evaluators navigate these complexities, we present a taxonomy for characterizing decisions made in designing an evaluation of an uncertainty visualization. Our taxonomy differentiates six levels of decisions that comprise an uncertainty visualization evaluation: the behavioral targets of the study, expected effects from an uncertainty visualization, evaluation goals, measures, elicitation techniques, and analysis approaches. Applying our taxonomy to 86 user studies of uncertainty visualizations, we find that existing evaluation practice, particularly in visualization research, focuses on Performance and Satisfaction-based measures that assume more predictable and statistically-driven judgment behavior than is suggested by research on human judgment and decision making. We reflect on common themes in evaluation practice concerning the interpretation and semantics of uncertainty, the use of confidence reporting, and a bias toward evaluating performance as accuracy rather than decision quality. We conclude with a concrete set of recommendations for evaluators designed to reduce the mismatch between the conceptualization of uncertainty in visualization versus other fields.", "cite": 12, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Correll,Michael", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "0", "target": "10"}, {"source": "0", "target": "11"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "7", "target": "12"}, {"source": "7", "target": "13"}, {"source": "8", "target": "10"}, {"source": "8", "target": "14"}, {"source": "8", "target": "11"}, {"source": "8", "target": "9"}, {"source": "9", "target": "10"}, {"source": "9", "target": "11"}, {"source": "10", "target": "14"}, {"source": "10", "target": "11"}, {"source": "11", "target": "14"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Correll,Michael", "1": "Sarikaya,Alper", "2": "Bartram,Lyn", "3": "Tory,Melanie", "4": "Fisher,Danyel", "5": "Li,Mingwei", "6": "Kindlmann,Gordon", "7": "Scheidegger,Carlos", "8": "Hullman,Jessica", "9": "Qiao,Xiaoli", "10": "Kale,Alex", "11": "Kay,Matthew", "12": "Faust,Rebecca", "13": "Glickenstein,David", "14": "Nguyen,Francis"}}
