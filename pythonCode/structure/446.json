Our method achieves exact energy conservation for the St. Venant-Kirchhoff material without any correction steps or extra parameters. Exact energy conservation implies that our resulting animations 1) cannot explode and 2) do not suffer from numerical damping, which are two common problems with previous numerical integration techniques. Our method produces lively motion even with large time steps as typically used in physics-based animation. Our implicit update rules can be formulated as a minimization problem and solved in a similar way as optimization-based backward Euler, with only a mild computing overhead. Our approach also supports damping and collision response models, making it easy to deploy in practical computer animation pipelines.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Detecting 3D Points of Interest Using Multiple Features and Stacked Auto-encoder", "author": ["Shu,Zhenyu", "Xin,Shiqing", "Xu,Xin", "Liu,Ligang", "Kavan,Ladislav"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2848628", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Considering the fact that points of interest on 3D shapes can be discriminated from a geometric perspective, it is reasonable to map the geometric signature of a point p to a probability value encoding to what degree p is a point of interest, especially for a specific class of 3D shapes. Based on the observation, we propose a three-phase algorithm for learning and predicting points of interest on 3D shapes by using multiple feature descriptors. Our algorithm requires two separate deep neural networks (stacked auto-encoders) to accomplish the task. During the first phase, we predict the membership of the given 3D shape according to a set of geometric descriptors using a deep neural network. After that, we train the other deep neural network to predict a probability distribution defined on the surface representing the possibility of a point being a point of interest. Finally, we use a manifold clustering technique to extract a set of points of interest as the output. Experimental results show superior detection performance of the proposed method over the previous state-of-the-art approaches.", "cite": 7, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Kavan,Ladislav", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}, {"id": "20"}, {"id": "21"}, {"id": "22"}, {"id": "23"}, {"id": "24"}, {"id": "25"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "8"}, {"source": "6", "target": "9"}, {"source": "6", "target": "10"}, {"source": "6", "target": "11"}, {"source": "6", "target": "12"}, {"source": "6", "target": "13"}, {"source": "6", "target": "14"}, {"source": "6", "target": "15"}, {"source": "6", "target": "16"}, {"source": "6", "target": "17"}, {"source": "6", "target": "18"}, {"source": "6", "target": "19"}, {"source": "6", "target": "20"}, {"source": "6", "target": "21"}, {"source": "6", "target": "22"}, {"source": "6", "target": "23"}, {"source": "6", "target": "24"}, {"source": "6", "target": "25"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Kavan,Ladislav", "1": "Rojas,Junior", "2": "Liu,Tiantian", "3": "Shu,Zhenyu", "4": "Xin,Shiqing", "5": "Xu,Xin", "6": "Liu,Ligang", "7": "Chai,Shuangming", "8": "Fu,Xiao-Ming", "9": "Wei,Mingqiang", "10": "Huang,Jin", "11": "Xie,Xingyu", "12": "Wang,Jun", "13": "Qin,Jing", "14": "Yang,Yang", "15": "Xiao,Shi-Wei", "16": "Zhang,Jie", "17": "Cao,Junjie", "18": "Liu,Xiuping", "19": "Chen,He", "20": "Li,Bo", "21": "Zhang,Juyong", "22": "Deng,Bailin", "23": "Hong,Yang", "24": "Peng,Yue", "25": "Qin,Wenjie"}}
