The number and type of crimes varies considerably around the city, assuming different patterns depending on urban and social characteristics. In this scenario, enabling tools to explore particular locations of the city is very important for domain experts to understand how urban features as to mobility, passersby behavior, and urban infrastructures can influence the quantity and type of crimes. In present work, we present CrimAnalyzer, a visualization assisted analytic tool that allows users to analyze crime behavior in specific regions of a city, providing new methodologies to identify local crime hotspots and their corresponding patterns over time. CrimAnalyzer has been developed from the demand of experts in criminology and it deals with three major challenges: i) flexibility to explore local regions and understand their crime patterns, ii) Identification of not only prevalent hotspots in terms of number of crimes but also hotspots where crimes are frequent but not in large amount, and iii) understand the dynamic of crime patterns over time. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed system are demonstrated by qualitative/quantitative comparisons as well as case studies involving real data and run by domain experts.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Multidimensional Projection for Visual Analytics: Linking Techniques with Distortions, Tasks, and Layout Enrichment", "author": ["Nonato,LuisGustavo", "Aupetit,Michael"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2846735", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Visual analysis of multidimensional data requires expressive and effective ways to reduce data dimensionality to encode them visually. Multidimensional projections (MDP) figure among the most important visualization techniques in this context, transforming multidimensional data into scatter plots whose visual patterns reflect some notion of similarity in the original data. However, MDP come with distortions that make these visual patterns not trustworthy, hindering users to infer actual data characteristics. Moreover, the patterns present in the scatter plots might not be enough to allow a clear understanding of multidimensional data, motivating the development of layout enrichment methodologies to operate together with MDP. This survey attempts to cover the main aspects of MDP as a visualization and visual analytic tool. It provides detailed analysis and taxonomies as to the organization of MDP techniques according to their main properties and traits, discussing the impact of such properties for visual perception and other human factors. The survey also approaches the different types of distortions that can result from MDP mappings and it overviews existing mechanisms to quantitatively evaluate such distortions. A qualitative analysis of the impact of distortions on the different analytic tasks performed by users when exploring multidimensional data through MDP is also presented. Guidelines for choosing the best MDP for an intended task are also provided as a result of this analysis. Finally, layout enrichment schemes to debunk MDP distortions and/or reveal relevant information not directly inferable from the scatter plot are reviewed and discussed in the light of new taxonomies. We conclude the survey providing future research axes to fill discovered gaps in this domain.", "cite": 12, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Nonato,LuisGustavo", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "7"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Nonato,LuisGustavo", "1": "GarciaZanabria,Germain", "2": "AlvarengaSilveira,Jaqueline", "3": "Poco,Jorge", "4": "Paiva,Afonso", "5": "BatistaNery,Marcelo", "6": "Silva,ClaudioT", "7": "AdornodeAbreu,SergioFranca", "8": "Aupetit,Michael"}}
