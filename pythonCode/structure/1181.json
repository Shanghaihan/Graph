We present a method for interactive labeling of crowded 3D scenes containing very many instances of objects spanning multiple scales in size. In contrast to previous labeling methods, we target cases where many instances of dozens of types are present and where the hierarchical structure of the objects in the scene presents an opportunity to choose the most suitable level for each placed label. Our solution builds on and goes beyond labeling techniques in medical 3D visualization. cartography. and biological illustrations from books and prints. In contrast to these techniques, the main characteristics of our new technique are: 1) a novel way of labeling objects as part of a bigger structure when appropriate, 2) visual clutter reduction by labeling only representative instances for each type of an object. and a strategy of selecting those. The appropriate level of label is chosen by analyzing the scene's depth buffer and the scene objects' hierarchy tree. We address the topic of communicating the parent-children relationship between labels by employing visual hierarchy concepts adapted from graphic design. Selecting representative instances considers several criteria tailored to the character of the data and is combined with a greedy optimization approach. We demonstrate the usage of our method with models from mesoscale biology where these two characteristics multi-scale and multi-instance are abundant: along with the fact that these scenes are extraordinarily dense.", "cite": 6, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Visualization of Large Molecular Trajectories", "author": ["Duran,David", "Hermosilla,Pedro", "Ropinski,Timo", "Kozlikova,Barbora", "Vinacua,Alvar", "Vazquez,Pere-Pau"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864851", "keywords": "", "abstract": "The analysis of protein-ligand interactions is a time-intensive task. Researchers have to analyze multiple physico-chemical properties of the protein at once and combine them to derive conclusions about the protein-ligand interplay. Typically, several charts are inspected, and 3D animations can be played side-by-side to obtain a deeper understanding of the data. With the advances in simulation techniques, larger and larger datasets are available, with up to hundreds of thousands of steps. Unfortunately, such large trajectories are very difficult to investigate with traditional approaches. Therefore, the need for special tools that facilitate inspection of these large trajectories becomes substantial. In this paper, we present a novel system for visual exploration of very large trajectories in an interactive and user-friendly way. Several visualization motifs are automatically derived from the data to give the user the information about interactions between protein and ligand. Our system offers specialized widgets to ease and accelerate data inspection and navigation to interesting parts of the simulation. The system is suitable also for simulations where multiple ligands are involved. We have tested the usefulness of our tool on a set of datasets obtained from protein engineers, and we describe the expert feedback.", "cite": 4, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Kozlikova,Barbora", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "0", "target": "10"}, {"source": "0", "target": "11"}, {"source": "0", "target": "12"}, {"source": "0", "target": "13"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "7"}, {"source": "1", "target": "8"}, {"source": "2", "target": "14"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "7"}, {"source": "2", "target": "8"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "8"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}, {"source": "4", "target": "8"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "7"}, {"source": "5", "target": "8"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "8"}, {"source": "7", "target": "8"}, {"source": "9", "target": "10"}, {"source": "9", "target": "11"}, {"source": "9", "target": "12"}, {"source": "9", "target": "13"}, {"source": "10", "target": "11"}, {"source": "10", "target": "12"}, {"source": "10", "target": "13"}, {"source": "11", "target": "15"}, {"source": "11", "target": "16"}, {"source": "11", "target": "17"}, {"source": "11", "target": "12"}, {"source": "11", "target": "13"}, {"source": "12", "target": "13"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Kozlikova,Barbora", "1": "Kouril,David", "2": "Cmolik,Ladislav", "3": "Wu,Hsiang-Yun", "4": "Johnson,Graham", "5": "Goodsell,DavidS.", "6": "Olson,Arthur", "7": "Groller,M.Eduard", "8": "Viola,Ivan", "9": "Duran,David", "10": "Hermosilla,Pedro", "11": "Ropinski,Timo", "12": "Vinacua,Alvar", "13": "Vazquez,Pere-Pau", "14": "Bittner,Jiri", "15": "Bruckner,Stefan", "16": "Isenberg,Tobias", "17": "Wiebel,Alexander"}}
