Previous methods for computing local histograms mainly work for regular or rectilinear grids only. In this paper, we develop theory and novel algorithms for computing local histograms in tetrahedral meshes and curvilinear grids. Our algorithms are theoretically sound and efficient, and work effectively and fast in practice. Our main focus is on scalar fields, but the algorithms also work for vector fields as a by-product with small, easy modifications. Our methods can benefit information theoretic and other distribution-driven analysis. The experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our new techniques, including a utility case study on tetrahedral vector field visualization.", "cite": 1, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Zhou,Bo", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Zhou,Bo", "1": "Chiang,Yi-Jen", "2": "Wang,Cong"}}
