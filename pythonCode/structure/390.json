However, such approaches have not been widely adopted in graphics mainly due to the underlying inaccuracy, instability and inflexibility. In this paper, we try to tackle these problems in order to make kinetic approaches practical for graphical applications. To achieve more accurate and stable simulations, we propose to employ the non-orthogonal central-moment-relaxation model, where we develop a novel adaptive relaxation method to retain both stability and accuracy in turbulent flows. To achieve flexibility, we propose a novel continuous-scale formulation that enables samples at arbitrary resolutions to easily communicate with each other in a more continuous sense and with loose geometrical constraints, which allows efficient and adaptive sample construction to better match the physical scale. Such a capability directly leads to an automatic sample construction which generates static and dynamic scales at initialization and during simulation, respectively. This effectively makes our method suitable for simulating turbulent flows with arbitrary geometrical boundaries. Our simulation results with applications to smoke animations show the benefits of our method, with comparisons for justification and verification.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Fast Texture Mapping Adjustment via Local/Global Optimization", "author": ["Li,Wei", "Gong,Huajun", "Yang,Ruigang"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2831220", "keywords": "", "abstract": "This paper deals with the texture mapping of a triangular mesh model given a set of calibrated images. Different from the traditional approach of applying projective texture mapping with model parameterizations, we develop an image-space texture optimization scheme that aims to reduce visible seams or misalignment at texture or depth boundaries. Our novel scheme starts with an efficient local (and parallel) texture adjustment scheme at these boundaries, followed by a global correction step to rectify potential texture distortions caused by the local movement. Our phased optimization scheme achieves 50 similar to 100 times speed up on GPU (or 6 x on CPU) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on a variety of models showed that we achieve this significant speedup without sacrificing texture quality. Our approach significantly improves resilience to modeling and calibration errors, thereby allowing fast and fully automatic creation of textured models using commodity depth sensors by untrained users.", "cite": 5, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Li,Wei", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}, {"source": "4", "target": "8"}, {"source": "4", "target": "9"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Li,Wei", "1": "Bai,Kai", "2": "Liu,Xiaopei", "3": "Gong,Huajun", "4": "Yang,Ruigang", "5": "Ren,Jiaping", "6": "Xiang,Wei", "7": "Xiao,Yangxi", "8": "Manocha,Dinesh", "9": "Jin,Xiaogang"}}
