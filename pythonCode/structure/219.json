In particular, indirect light contains a myriad of information about the complex appearance of materials useful for computer vision and inverse rendering applications. In this paper, we present a new imaging technique that captures and analyzes components of indirect light via light transport using a synchronized projector-camera system. The rectified system illuminates the scene with epipolar planes corresponding to projector rows, and we vary two key parameters to capture plane-to-ray light transport between projector row and camera pixel: (1)the offset between projector row and camera row in the rolling shutter, and (2)the exposure of the camera row. We describe how this synchronized rolling shutter performs illumination multiplexing, and develop a nonlinear optimization algorithm to demultiplex the resulting 3D light transport operator. Using our system, we are able to capture live short and long-range indirect light transport, disambiguate subsurface scattering, diffuse and specular interreflections, and distinguish materials according to their subsurface scattering properties. In particular, we show the utility of indirect imaging for capturing and analyzing the hidden structure of veins in human skin.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Jayasuriya,Suren", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Jayasuriya,Suren", "1": "Kubo,Hiroyuki", "2": "Iwaguchi,Takafumi", "3": "Funatomi,Takuya", "4": "Mukaigawa,Yasuhiro", "5": "Narasimhan,SrinivasaG"}}
