For this, we train models to predict future data values at a given position based on the past values in its neighborhood, capturing common temporal behavior in the data. We then evaluate the model's prediction on the same data. High prediction error means that the local behavior was too complex, unique or uncertain to be accurately captured during training, indicating spatiotemporal regions with interesting behavior. By training several models of varying capacity, we are able to detect spatiotemporal regions of various complexities. We aggregate the obtained prediction errors into a time series or spatial volumes and visualize them together to highlight regions of unpredictable behavior and how they differ between the models. We demonstrate two further volumetric applications: adaptive timestep selection and analysis of ensemble dissimilarity. We apply our technique to datasets from multiple application domains and demonstrate that we are able to produce meaningful results while making minimal assumptions about the underlying data.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Feature-Based Volumetric Terrain Generation and Decoration", "author": ["Becher,Michael", "Krone,Michael", "Reina,Guido", "Ertl,Thomas"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2017.2762304", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Two-dimensional height fields are the most common data structure used for storing and rendering of terrain in offline rendering and especially real-time computer graphics. By its very nature, a height field cannot store terrain structures with multiple vertical layers such as overhanging cliffs, caves, or arches. This restriction does not apply to volumetric data structures. However, the workflow of manual modelling and editing of volumetric terrain usually is tedious and very time-consuming. Therefore, we propose to use three-dimensional curve-based primitives to efficiently model prominent, large-scale terrain features. We present a technique for volumetric generation of a complete terrain surface from the sparse input data by means of diffusion-based algorithms. By combining an efficient, feature-based toolset with a volumetric terrain representation, the modelling workflow is accelerated and simplified while retaining the full artistic freedom of volumetric terrains. Feature Curves also contain material information that can be complemented with local details by using per-face texture mapping. All stages of our method are GPU-accelerated using compute shaders to ensure interactive editing of terrain.

While interactive visualizations are increasingly available for public use, we still know little about how the general public discovers what they can do with these visualizations and what interactions are available. Developing a better understanding of this discovery process can help inform the design of visualizations for the general public, which in turn can help make data more accessible. To unpack this problem, we conducted a lab study in which participants were free to use their own methods to discover the functionality of a connected set of interactive visualizations of public energy data. We collected eye movement data and interaction logs as well as video and audio recordings. By analyzing this combined data, we extract exploration strategies that the participants employed to discover the functionality in these interactive visualizations. These exploration strategies illuminate possible design directions for improving the discoverability of a visualization's functionality.", "cite": 4, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Visualization of Bubble Formation in Porous Media", "author": ["Zhang,Hui", "Frey,Steffen", "Steeb,Holger", "Uribe,David", "Ertl,Thomas", "Wang,Wenping"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864506", "keywords": "", "abstract": "We present a visualization approach for the analysis of CO2 bubble-induced attenuation in porous rock formations.

To allow for the meaningful direct visual comparison of bubbles and their structures, we propose a customized registration technique considering the bubble shape as well as its points of contact with the porous media surface. With our quantitative extraction of geometric bubble features, we further support the analysis as well as the creation of a physical model.
