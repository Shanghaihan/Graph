In a recent publication we showed how to port a clever state of the art k-d tree construction algorithm to a multi-core CPU architecture and by means of thorough optimization we were able to obtain interactive reconstruction rates for moderately sized to large data sets. The construction scheme is based on maintaining partial summed-volume tables that fit in the L1 cache of the multi-core CPU and that allow for fast occupancy queries. In this work we propose a GPU implementation of the parallel k-d tree construction algorithm and compare it with the original multi-core CPU implementation. We conduct a thorough comparative study that outlines performance and scalability of our implementation.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Lang,Ulrich", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Lang,Ulrich", "1": "Zellmann,Stefan", "2": "Schulze,JurgenP"}}
