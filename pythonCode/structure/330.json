We identify two issues with their method which we call the node split and short-circuit problems, and solve both by modifying the routing graph to retain the hierarchical structure of power groups. We also classify the exact type of confluent drawings that the algorithm can produce as 'power-confluent', and prove that it is a subclass of the previously studied 'strict confluent' drawing.

We present an algorithm to minimize its energy function, known as stress, by using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to move a single pair of vertices at a time. Our results show that SGD can reach lower stress levels faster and more consistently than majorization, without needing help from a good initialization. We then show how the unique properties of SGD make it easier to produce constrained layouts than previous approaches. We also show how SGD can be directly applied within the sparse stress approximation of Ortmann et al.
