CMed can be used to visualize, classify, and filter crowdsourced clinical data based on a number of different metrics such as detection rate, logged events, and clustering of the annotations. CMed provides several interactive linked visualization components to analyze the crowd annotation results for a particular video and the associated workers. Additionally, all results of an individual worker can be inspected using multiple linked views in our CMed framework. We allow a crowdsourcing application analyst to observe patterns and gather insights into the crowdsourced medical data, helping him/her design future crowdsourcing applications for optimal output from the workers. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework with two medical crowdsourcing studies: polyp detection in virtual colonoscopy videos and lung nodule detection in CT thin-slab maximum intensity projection videos. We also provide experts' feedback to show the effectiveness of our framework. Lastly, we share the lessons we learned from our framework with suggestions for integrating our framework into a clinical workflow.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Visual Analysis of a Computer-Aided Diagnosis System for Pancreatic Lesions.", "author": ["Dmitriev,Konstantin", "Marino,Joseph", "Baker,Kevin", "Kaufman,ArieE"], "soname": "IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2019.2947037", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Machine learning is a powerful and effective tool for medical image analysis to perform computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Having great potential in improving the accuracy of a diagnosis, CAD systems are often analyzed in terms of the final accuracy, leading to a limited understanding of the internal decision process, impossibility to gain insights, and ultimately to skepticism from clinicians. We present a visual analysis approach to uncover the decision-making process of a CAD system for classifying pancreatic cystic lesions. This CAD algorithm consists of two distinct components: random forest (RF), which classifies a set of predefined features, including demographic features, and a convolutional neural network (CNN), which analyzes radiological features of the lesions. We study the class probabilities generated by the RF and the semantical meaning of the features learned by the CNN. We also use an eye tracker to better understand which radiological features are particularly useful for a radiologist to make a diagnosis and to quantitatively compare with the features that lead the CNN to its final classification decision. Additionally, we evaluate the effects and benefits of supplying the CAD system with a case-based \"visual aid\" in a second-reader setting.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Kaufman,ArieE", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "7"}, {"source": "2", "target": "8"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "9"}, {"source": "3", "target": "10"}, {"source": "3", "target": "11"}, {"source": "3", "target": "8"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "12"}, {"source": "4", "target": "13"}, {"source": "4", "target": "14"}, {"source": "4", "target": "8"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Kaufman,ArieE", "1": "Park,JiHwan", "2": "Nadeem,Saad", "3": "Boorboor,Saeed", "4": "Marino,Joseph", "5": "Dmitriev,Konstantin", "6": "Baker,Kevin", "7": "Jadhav,Shreeraj", "8": "Kaufman,Arie", "9": "Ananth,Mala", "10": "Talmage,David", "11": "Role,Lorna", "12": "Mirhosseini,Seyedkoosha", "13": "Gutenko,Ievgeniia", "14": "Ojal,Sushant"}}
