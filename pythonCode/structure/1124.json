Here we introduce the concept of information olfactation as the fragrant sibling of information visualization. and discuss how scent can be used to convey data. Building on a review of the human olfactory system and mirroring common visualization practice. we propose olfactory marks, the substrate in which they exist. and their olfactory channels that are available to designers. To exemplify this idea, we present vlScENT: A six-scent stereo olfactory display capable of conveying olfactory glyphs of varying temperature and direction. as well as a corresponding software system that integrates the display with a traditional visualization display. Finally, we present three applications that make use of the viScent system: A 2D graph visualization, a 2D line and point chart. and an immersive analytics graph visualization in 3D virtual reality. We close the paper with a review of possible extensions of viScent and applications of information olfactation for general visualization beyond the examples in this paper.", "cite": 3, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Batch,Andrea", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "7"}, {"source": "2", "target": "8"}, {"source": "2", "target": "9"}, {"source": "2", "target": "10"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Batch,Andrea", "1": "Patnaik,Biswaksen", "2": "Elmqvist,Niklas", "3": "Badam,SriramKarthik", "4": "Mathisen,Andreas", "5": "Radle,Roman", "6": "Klokmose,ClemensN.", "7": "Liu,Zhicheng", "8": "Ondov,Brian", "9": "Jardine,Nicole", "10": "Franconeri,Steven"}}
