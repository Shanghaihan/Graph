Analysts often interweave querying and mining in a recursive manner during event sequence analysis: sequences extracted as query results are used for mining patterns, patterns generated are incorporated into a new query for segmenting the sequences, and the resulting segments are mined or queried again. To support flexible analysis, we propose a framework that describes the process of interwoven querying and mining. Based on this framework, we developed MAQUI, a Mining And Querying User Interface that enables recursive event sequence exploration. To understand the efficacy of MAQUI, we conducted two case studies with domain experts. The findings suggest that the capability of interweaving querying and mining helps the participants articulate their questions and gain novel insights from their data.", "cite": 6, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Elastic Documents: Coupling Text and Tables through Contextual Visualizations for Enhanced Document Reading", "author": ["Badam,SriramKarthik", "Liu,Zhicheng", "Elmqvist,Niklas"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865119", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Today's data-rich documents are often complex datasets in themselves, consisting of information in different formats such as text, figures, and data tables. These additional media augment the textual narrative in the document. However, the static layout of a traditional for-print document often impedes deep understanding of its content because of the need to navigate to access content scattered throughout the text. In this paper, we seek to facilitate enhanced comprehension of such documents through a contextual visualization technique that couples text content with data tables contained in the document. We parse the text content and data tables, cross-link the components using a keyword-based matching algorithm, and generate on-demand visualizations based on the reader's current focus within a document. We evaluate this technique in a user study comparing our approach to a traditional reading experience. Results from our study show that (1) participants comprehend the content better with tighter coupling of text and data, (2) the contextual visualizations enable participants to develop better summaries that capture the main data-rich insights within the document, and (3) overall, our method enables participants to develop a more detailed understanding of the document content.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Liu,Zhicheng", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "4", "target": "8"}, {"source": "4", "target": "9"}, {"source": "4", "target": "10"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "5", "target": "8"}, {"source": "5", "target": "9"}, {"source": "5", "target": "10"}, {"source": "5", "target": "11"}, {"source": "5", "target": "12"}, {"source": "5", "target": "13"}, {"source": "5", "target": "14"}, {"source": "5", "target": "15"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Liu,Zhicheng", "1": "Law,Po-Ming", "2": "Malik,Sana", "3": "Basole,RahulC.", "4": "Badam,SriramKarthik", "5": "Elmqvist,Niklas", "6": "Wu,Yanhong", "7": "Major,Timothy", "8": "Mathisen,Andreas", "9": "Radle,Roman", "10": "Klokmose,ClemensN.", "11": "Patnaik,Biswaksen", "12": "Batch,Andrea", "13": "Ondov,Brian", "14": "Jardine,Nicole", "15": "Franconeri,Steven"}}
