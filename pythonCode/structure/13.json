Despite its potential benefits, intermediate knowledge from progressive analytics can be incorrect due to various machine and human factors, such as a sampling bias or misinterpretation of uncertainty. To alleviate this problem, we introduce PVA-Guards, safeguards people can leave on uncertain intermediate knowledge that needs to be verified, and derive seven PVA-Guards based on previous visualization task taxonomies. PVA-Guards provide a means of ensuring the correctness of the conclusion and understanding the reason when intermediate knowledge becomes invalid. We also present ProReveal, a proof-of-concept system designed and developed to integrate the seven safeguards into progressive data exploration. Finally, we report a user study with 14 participants, which show people voluntarily employed PVA-Guards to safeguard their findings and ProReveal's PVA-Guard view provides an overview of uncertain intermediate knowledge. We believe our new concept can also offer better consistency in progressive data exploration, alleviating people's heterogeneous interpretation of uncertainty.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Lyi,Sehi", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "7"}, {"source": "2", "target": "8"}, {"source": "2", "target": "9"}, {"source": "2", "target": "10"}, {"source": "2", "target": "11"}, {"source": "2", "target": "12"}, {"source": "2", "target": "13"}, {"source": "3", "target": "14"}, {"source": "3", "target": "15"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Lyi,Sehi", "1": "Jo,Jaemin", "2": "Lee,Bongshin", "3": "Seo,Jinwook", "4": "Vernier,Frederic", "5": "Dragicevic,Pierre", "6": "Fekete,Jean-Daniel", "7": "Brehmer,Matthew", "8": "Isenberg,Petra", "9": "Choe,EunKyoung", "10": "Blascheck,Tanja", "11": "Besancon,Lonni", "12": "Bezerianos,Anastasia", "13": "Ren,Donghao", "14": "Maciejewski,Ross", "15": "Westermann,Rudiger"}}
