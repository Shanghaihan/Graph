Each element is represented as a mass-spring system, allowing it to deform to achieve a better fit with its neighbours and the container. We start with an initial placement of small elements and gradually transform them using a physics simulation that trades off between the evenness of the packing and the deformations of the individual elements. Unlike previous work, elements can be given preferred orientations, and we can use shape matching to control the initial placement of elements in tight convex corners. We also explore the creation of tileable packings, and validate our approach using statistical measurements of the distributions of positive and negative space in packings. Our method produces compositions in which the negative space between elements is approximately uniform in width, similar to real-world examples created by artists.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Asente,Paul", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Asente,Paul", "1": "Saputra,RezaAdhitya", "2": "Kaplan,Craig"}}
