Prior work has mainly investigated how to support the expressive design of a wide range of charts generated from tabular data: bar charts, scatterplots, maps, etc. We focus here on an expressive design environment for node-link diagrams generated from multivariate networks. Such data structures raise specific challenges and opportunities in terms of visual design and interactive authoring. We discuss those specificities and describe the user-centered design process that led to Graphies, a prototype environment for expressive node-link diagram authoring. We then report on a study in which participants successfully reproduced several expressive designs, and created their own designs as well.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Romat,Hugo", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Romat,Hugo", "1": "Appert,Caroline", "2": "Pietriga,Emmanuel", "3": "Lobo,Maria-Jesus"}}
