We demonstrate our computational phase-modulated eyeglasses with either a single PSLM or dual PSLMs and show that the concept can realize various optical operations including focus correction, bi-focus, image shift, and field of view manipulation, namely optical zoom. Compared to other programmable optics, computational phase-modulated eyeglasses have the advantage in terms of its versatility.

To control the appearance of an object by using a projector-camera system, appropriate reflectance estimation is vital to the creation of an appropriate projection image. Most conventional estimation methods have assumed a static light condition although, in practice, the appearance is affected not only by the reflectance but also by the environmental light. In a dynamically changing light environment, conventional methods must be capable of applying calibrations every time the conditions change. Our method is based on a concept of creating two different light conditions by switching the projection at a rate that is higher than what the human eye can perceive, capturing images of a target object separately under each condition. Our method simultaneously estimates the reflectance and environmental light by using a pair of images acquired under two conditions. We implemented a projector-camera system that switches the projection on and off at 120 Hz. We conducted two experiments to confirm the robustness when changing the brightness and the color saturation of the environmental light, respectively. The results indicated our method is capable of robustly estimating the reflectance under practical indoor lighting conditions.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Light Attenuation Display: Subtractive See-Through Near-Eye Display via Spatial Color Filtering", "author": ["Itoh,Yuta", "Langlotz,Tobias", "Iwai,Daisuke", "Kiyokawa,Kiyoshi", "Amano,Toshiyuki"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2019.2899229", "keywords": "", "abstract": "We present a display for optical see-through near-eye displays based on light attenuation, a new paradigm that forms images by spatially subtracting colors of light. Existing optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs) form virtual images in an additive manner-they optically combine the light from an embedded light source such as a microdisplay into the users' field of view (FoV). Instead, our light attenuation display filters the color of the real background light pixel-wise in the users' see-through view. resulting in an image as a spatial color filter. Our image formation is complementary to existing light-additive OST-HMDs. The core optical component in our system is a phase-only spatial light modulator (PSLM). a liquid crystal module that can control the phase of the light in each pixel. By combining PSLMs with polarization optics, our system realizes a spatially programmable color filter.
