The scene geometry is simplified with a 2D array of voxelizations computed from different directions, sampling the space of all possible directions. The 2D array of voxelizations is compressed using a vector quantization approach. The ray-scene intersection is approximated using the voxelization whose rows are most closely aligned with the ray. The voxelization row that contains the ray is looked up, the row is truncated to the extent of the ray using bit operations, and a truncated row with non-zero bits indicates that the ray intersects the scene. We support dynamic scenes with rigidly moving objects by building a separate 2D array of voxelizations for each type of object, and by using the same 2D array of voxelizations for all instances of an object type. We support complex dynamic scenes and scenes with deforming geometry by computing and rotating a single voxelization on the fly. We demonstrate the benefits of our method in the context of interactive rendering of scenes with thousands of moving lights, where we compare our method to ray tracing, to conventional shadow mapping, and to imperfect shadow maps.", "cite": 3, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Meng,Chunlei", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Meng,Chunlei", "1": "Wang,Lili", "2": "Liang,Xinglun", "3": "Popescu,Voicu", "4": "Wu,Jian", "5": "Yang,Xuefeng", "6": "Andersen,Daniel", "7": "Villano,Peter"}}
