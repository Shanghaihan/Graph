Currently there are limited approaches that allow an investigator to explore the network, text and metadata in a unified manner. We developed Beagle as a forensic tool for email datasets that allows investigators to flexibly form complex queries in order to discover important information in email data. Beagle was successfully deployed at a security firm which had a large email dataset that was difficult to properly investigate. We discuss our experience developing Beagle as well as the lessons we learned applying visual analytic techniques to a difficult real-world problem.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Jakobsson,Markus", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Jakobsson,Markus", "1": "Koven,Jay", "2": "Felix,Cristian", "3": "Siadati,Hossein", "4": "Bertini,Enrico", "5": "Ming,Yao", "6": "Qu,Huamin"}}
