Since HMDs offer sufficient contact area to integrate additional actuators, prior works utilised a limited amount of haptic actuators to integrate respective information about the virtual world. With the Face/On prototype complex feedback patterns are introduced that combine a high number of vibration motors with additional thermal sources to transport multi-modal and spatial information. A pre-study determining the boundaries of the feedbacks' intensities as well as a user study showing a significant increase of presence and enjoyment validate Face/On's approach.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Rietzler,Michael", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Rietzler,Michael", "1": "Wolf,Dennis", "2": "Hnatek,Leo", "3": "Rukzio,Enrico"}}
