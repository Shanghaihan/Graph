Coordinated relationships can be formalized as biclusters. In order to support visual exploration of biclusters, bipartite graphs based visualizations have been proposed, and edge bundling is used to show biclusters. However, it suffers from edge crossings due to possible overlaps of biclusters, and lacks in-depth understanding of its impact on user exploring biclusters in bipartite graphs. To address these, we propose a novel bicluster-based seriation technique that can reduce edge crossings in bipartite graphs drawing and conducted a user experiment to study the effect of edge bundling and this proposed technique on visualizing biclusters in bipartite graphs. We found that they both had impact on reducing entity visits for users exploring biclusters, and edge bundles helped them find more justified answers. Moreover, we identified four key trade-offs that inform the design of future bicluster visualizations. The study results suggest that edge bundling is critical for exploring biclusters in bipartite graphs, which helps to reduce low-level perceptual problems and support high-level inferences.", "cite": 1, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Enhancing Web-based Analytics Applications through Provenance", "author": ["Camisetty,Akhilesh", "Chandurkar,Chaitanya", "Sun,Maoyuan", "Koop,David"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865039", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Visual analytics systems continue to integrate new technologies and leverage modern environments for exploration and collaboration, making tools and techniques available to a wide audience through web browsers. Many of these systems have been developed with rich interactions, offering users the opportunity to examine details and explore hypotheses that have not been directly encoded by a designer. Understanding is enhanced when users can replay and revisit the steps in the sensemaking process, and in collaborative settings, it is especially important to be able to review not only the current state but also what decisions were made along the way. Unfortunately, many web-based systems lack the ability to capture such reasoning, and the path to a result is transient, forgotten when a user moves to a new view. This paper explores the requirements to augment existing client-side web applications with support for capturing, reviewing, sharing, and reusing steps in the reasoning process. Furthermore, it considers situations where decisions are made with streaming data, and the insights gained from revisiting those choices when more data is available. It presents a proof of concept, the Shareable Interactive Manipulation Provenance framework (SIMProv.js), that addresses these requirements in a modern, client-side JavaScript library, and describes how it can be integrated with existing frameworks.", "cite": 3, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Sun,Maoyuan", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "9"}, {"source": "1", "target": "10"}, {"source": "1", "target": "11"}, {"source": "1", "target": "12"}, {"source": "1", "target": "13"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "14"}, {"source": "4", "target": "15"}, {"source": "4", "target": "16"}, {"source": "4", "target": "17"}, {"source": "4", "target": "18"}, {"source": "4", "target": "19"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "8"}, {"source": "7", "target": "8"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Sun,Maoyuan", "1": "Zhao,Jian", "2": "Wu,Hao", "3": "Luther,Kurt", "4": "North,Chris", "5": "Ramakrishnan,Naren", "6": "Camisetty,Akhilesh", "7": "Chandurkar,Chaitanya", "8": "Koop,David", "9": "Lu,Zhicong", "10": "Fan,Mingming", "11": "Wang,Yun", "12": "Annett,Michelle", "13": "Wigdor,Daniel", "14": "Reach,AndrewMcCaleb", "15": "Dowling,Michelle", "16": "Wenskovitch,John", "17": "Fry,J.T.", "18": "Leman,Scotland", "19": "House,Leanna"}}
