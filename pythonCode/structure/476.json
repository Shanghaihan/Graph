To provide an overview of the relevant techniques and analysis tasks, as well as the relationships between them, we comprehensively analyzed 263 visualization papers and 4,346 mining papers published between 1992-2017 in two fields: visualization and text mining. From the analysis, we derived around 300 concepts (visualization techniques, mining techniques, and analysis tasks) and built a taxonomy for each type of concept. The co-occurrence relationships between the concepts were also extracted. Our research can be used as a stepping-stone for other researchers to 1) understand a common set of concepts used in this research topic; 2) facilitate the exploration of the relationships between visualization techniques, mining techniques, and analysis tasks; 3) understand the current practice in developing visual text analytics tools; 4) seek potential research opportunities by narrowing the gulf between visualization and mining techniques based on the analysis tasks; and 5) analyze other interdisciplinary research areas in a similar way. We have also contributed a web-based visualization tool for analyzing and understanding research trends and opportunities in visual text analytics.", "cite": 11, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "An Interactive Method to Improve Crowdsourced Annotations", "author": ["Liu,Shixia", "Chen,Changjian", "Lu,Yafeng", "Ouyang,Fangxin", "Wang,Bin"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864843", "keywords": "", "abstract": "In order to effectively infer correct labels from noisy crowdsourced annotations, learning-from-crowds models have introduced expert validation. However, little research has been done on facilitating the validation procedure. In this paper, we propose an interactive method to assist experts in verifying uncertain instance labels and unreliable workers. Given the instance labels and worker reliability inferred from a learning-from-crowds model; candidate instances and workers are selected for expert validation. The influence of verified results is propagated to relevant instances and workers through the learning-from-crowds model. To facilitate the validation of annotations, we have developed a confusion visualization to indicate the confusing classes for further exploration, a constrained projection method to show the uncertain labels in context, and a scatter-plot-based visualization to illustrate worker reliability. The three visualizations are tightly integrated with the learning-from-crowds model to provide an iterative and progressive environment for data validation. Two case studies were conducted that demonstrate our approach offers an efficient method for validating and improving crowdsourced annotations.", "cite": 9, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Liu,Shixia", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}, {"id": "13"}, {"id": "14"}, {"id": "15"}, {"id": "16"}, {"id": "17"}, {"id": "18"}, {"id": "19"}, {"id": "20"}, {"id": "21"}, {"id": "22"}, {"id": "23"}, {"id": "24"}, {"id": "25"}, {"id": "26"}, {"id": "27"}, {"id": "28"}, {"id": "29"}, {"id": "30"}, {"id": "31"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "0", "target": "10"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "7"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "7"}, {"source": "2", "target": "11"}, {"source": "2", "target": "12"}, {"source": "2", "target": "13"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}, {"source": "4", "target": "8"}, {"source": "4", "target": "9"}, {"source": "4", "target": "10"}, {"source": "5", "target": "14"}, {"source": "5", "target": "13"}, {"source": "5", "target": "15"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "7"}, {"source": "5", "target": "11"}, {"source": "5", "target": "12"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "7", "target": "16"}, {"source": "7", "target": "17"}, {"source": "7", "target": "18"}, {"source": "7", "target": "19"}, {"source": "7", "target": "20"}, {"source": "7", "target": "21"}, {"source": "7", "target": "15"}, {"source": "8", "target": "9"}, {"source": "8", "target": "10"}, {"source": "9", "target": "22"}, {"source": "9", "target": "23"}, {"source": "9", "target": "24"}, {"source": "9", "target": "25"}, {"source": "9", "target": "26"}, {"source": "9", "target": "10"}, {"source": "9", "target": "27"}, {"source": "9", "target": "28"}, {"source": "9", "target": "29"}, {"source": "9", "target": "30"}, {"source": "9", "target": "31"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Liu,Shixia", "1": "Wang,Xiting", "2": "Collins,Christopher", "3": "Dou,Wenwen", "4": "Ouyang,Fangxin", "5": "El-Assady,Mennatallah", "6": "Jiang,Liu", "7": "Keim,DanielA.", "8": "Chen,Changjian", "9": "Lu,Yafeng", "10": "Wang,Bin", "11": "Sperrle,Fabian", "12": "Deussen,Oliver", "13": "Keim,Daniel", "14": "Streeb,Dirk", "15": "Chen,Min", "16": "Buchmueller,Jun", "17": "Jaeckie,Dominik", "18": "Cakmak,Eren", "19": "Brandes,Ulrik", "20": "Sacha,Dominik", "21": "Kraus,Matthias", "22": "Chen,Hang", "23": "Kobourov,StephenG", "24": "Maciejewski,Ross", "25": "Huroyan,Vahan", "26": "Soni,Utkarsh", "27": "Wang,Hong", "28": "Shutters,ShadeT.", "29": "Steptoe,Michael", "30": "Wang,Feng", "31": "Landis,Steven"}}
