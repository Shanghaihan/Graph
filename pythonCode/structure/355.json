While numerous academic papers investigated how to make the scheduling process of meetings faster or even automatic, little work has been done yet to facilitate the retrospective reasoning about how time is spent on meetings. Traditional calendar applications do not allow users to extract actionable statistics although it has been shown that reflection-oriented design can increase the users' understanding of their habits and can thereby encourage a shift towards better practices. In this paper, we present MineTime Insight, a tool made of multiple coordinated views for the exploration of personal calendar data, with the overarching goal of improving short and long-term scheduling decisions. Despite being focused on the working environment, our work builds upon recent results in the field of Personal Visual Analytics, as it targets users not necessarily expert in visualization and data analysis. We demonstrate the potential of MineTime Insight, when applied to the agenda of an executive manager. Finally, we discuss the results of an informal user study and a field study. Our results suggest that our visual representations are perceived as easy to understand and helpful towards a change in the scheduling habits.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Objective Vortex Corelines of Finite-sized Objects in Fluid Flows", "author": ["Guenther,Tobias", "Theisel,Holger"], "soname": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS", "DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864828", "keywords": "", "abstract": "Vortices are one of the most-frequently studied phenomena in fluid flows. The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.", "cite": 2, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Guenther,Tobias", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Guenther,Tobias", "1": "Ancona,Marco", "2": "Beyeler,Marilou", "3": "Gross,Markus", "4": "Theisel,Holger", "5": "Wilde,Thomas", "6": "Rossl,Christian"}}
