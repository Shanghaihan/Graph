We discuss the potential relationships between simulator sickness, immersion, and presence. We used two different camera pose (position and orientation) estimation methods for the evaluation of motion tasks in a large-scale VR environment: a simple model and an optimized model that allows for a more accurate and natural mapping of human senses. Participants performed multiple motion tasks (walking, balancing, running) in three conditions: a physical reality baseline condition, a VR condition with the simple model, and a VR condition with the optimized model. We compared these conditions with regard to the resulting sickness and gait, as well as the perceived presence in the VR conditions. The subjective measures confirmed that the optimized pose estimation model reduces simulator sickness and increases the perceived presence. The results further show that both models affect the gait parameters and simulator sickness, which is why we further investigated a classification approach that deals with non-linear correlation dependencies between gait parameters and simulator sickness. We argue that our approach could be used to assess and predict simulator sickness based on human gait parameters and we provide implications for future research.", "cite": 0, "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Not Alone Here?!

We demonstrate the close relationship between scalability, reproduction accuracy, and the resulting performance characteristics, as well as the impact of these characteristics on users co-located with larger groups of embodied virtual others. System scalability provides a variable number of co-located avatars and Al-controlled agents with a variety of different appearances, including realistic-looking virtual humans generated from photogrammetry scans. The article reports on how to meet the requirements of embodied SVR with today's technical off-the-shelf solutions and what to expect regarding features, performance, and potential limitations. Special care has been taken to achieve low latencies and sufficient frame rates necessary for reliable communication of embodied social signals. We propose a hybrid evaluation approach which coherently relates results from technical benchmarks to subjective ratings and which confirms required performance characteristics for the target scenario of larger distributed groups. A user-study reveals positive effects of an increasing number of co-located social companions on the quality of experience of virtual worlds, i.e., on presence, possibility of interaction, and co-presence. It also shows that variety in avatar/agent appearance might increase eeriness but might also stimulate an increased interest of participants about the environment.", "cite": 4, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Latoschik,MarcErich", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}, {"id": "4"}, {"id": "5"}, {"id": "6"}, {"id": "7"}, {"id": "8"}, {"id": "9"}, {"id": "10"}, {"id": "11"}, {"id": "12"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "0", "target": "4"}, {"source": "0", "target": "5"}, {"source": "0", "target": "6"}, {"source": "0", "target": "7"}, {"source": "0", "target": "8"}, {"source": "0", "target": "9"}, {"source": "0", "target": "10"}, {"source": "0", "target": "11"}, {"source": "0", "target": "12"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "4"}, {"source": "1", "target": "5"}, {"source": "1", "target": "6"}, {"source": "1", "target": "7"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "4"}, {"source": "2", "target": "5"}, {"source": "2", "target": "6"}, {"source": "2", "target": "7"}, {"source": "3", "target": "4"}, {"source": "3", "target": "5"}, {"source": "3", "target": "6"}, {"source": "3", "target": "7"}, {"source": "4", "target": "5"}, {"source": "4", "target": "6"}, {"source": "4", "target": "7"}, {"source": "5", "target": "6"}, {"source": "5", "target": "7"}, {"source": "6", "target": "7"}, {"source": "8", "target": "9"}, {"source": "8", "target": "10"}, {"source": "8", "target": "11"}, {"source": "8", "target": "12"}, {"source": "9", "target": "10"}, {"source": "9", "target": "11"}, {"source": "9", "target": "12"}, {"source": "10", "target": "11"}, {"source": "10", "target": "12"}, {"source": "11", "target": "12"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Latoschik,MarcErich", "1": "Feigl,Tobias", "2": "Roth,Daniel", "3": "Gradl,Stefan", "4": "Wirth,Markus", "5": "Eskofier,BjoernM.", "6": "Philippsen,Michael", "7": "Mutschler,Christopher", "8": "Kern,Florian", "9": "Stauffert,Jan-Philipp", "10": "Bartl,Andrea", "11": "Botsch,Mario", "12": "Lugrin,Jean-Luc"}}
