Gaia's data release 2 represents the largest catalog of the stars of our Galaxy, comprising 1.3 billion star positions, with parallaxes, proper motions, magnitudes, and colors. In this mission, Gaia Sky is the central tool for off-the-shelf visualization of these data, and for aiding production of outreach material. With its capabilities to effectively handle these data, to enable seamless navigation along the high dynamic range of distances, and at the same time to provide advanced visualization techniques including relativistic aberration and gravitational wave effects, currently no actively maintained cross-platform, modern, and open alternative exists.", "cite": 3, "year": "2019"}], "name": "Sadlo,Filip", "nodes": [{"id": "0"}, {"id": "1"}, {"id": "2"}, {"id": "3"}], "edgess": [{"source": "0", "target": "1"}, {"source": "0", "target": "2"}, {"source": "0", "target": "3"}, {"source": "1", "target": "2"}, {"source": "1", "target": "3"}, {"source": "2", "target": "3"}], "year": 2019, "authorId": {"0": "Sadlo,Filip", "1": "Sagrista,Antoni", "2": "Jordan,Stefan", "3": "Mueller,Thomas"}}
